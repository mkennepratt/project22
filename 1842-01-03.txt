I confess to you. sir. -.id to this goodly compnny,com
posed ax it it of many of tne most eminent and t nlighl.-n
od men of t wo great states, that I terl an tiuworthiness to
speak o' or lor the state of N.-w Voik. I would daro to
speak for modern times? I m ght dare to t|>?ak for my

very names have awed this festive meeting into profouu I
silence?1 feel that 1 am unworthy to sp.ak tor N.w
Voi k, concerning her moral, p.y sicalor intellectual improvement.
If I were not born, I was brought op, a
sceptic ou the subject ugiv brought home to ns. Of all
thnacbifreT-httP! "tv youth, the bravest, lint I now
recollect, w as one that 1 undertook near the close ol mjr
col egiate life. This achievement consist. <1 in the production
of an esmy, iu which I demonstrated to iny own
satisfaction, thst the Krie canal project was an impossibility,
aud that if it could ever he completed, it would involve
tlio state in rtiin. [Laughter ] And here 1 am to
make my confession, standing, as I do, self convicted of
the inconsistency of having at. middle age, so far gone to
the other extreme, as to have recommeaded not merely
an enlargement of that channel to twice its oiigiualca
parity, hut also the construction of three great lines of
rsilw ays, to accommodate the excess ol travel and transportation
between the seaboard and the broad west

plished. Thete remark* may not be without in
tcreit to our friends of the Kaat, us indicating the
confident belief entertained here concerning the
profitableness and urn ftilnoia ol their enterprise.?
But, continued the Governor, this is no time for any
mcie local reminiscences. It ia an occasion on which
piivate feeling and local jealousies a-n.l iuteresta, as
well a* State' pride, might well be excluded Allmch
feeling should he lost in the sentiment that another hand
ia added to the union of these free States. The citizens
al Boston have a higher suhj-ct of reflection and consolation
even than those so justly insisted upon by my
learned friend (VIr. Austin) Massachusetts, after heing
the first to give the impulse to the hall of independence,
comes forward now in nu hour of trial, tomaiotuiu with
her indomitable energy, the only policy that can bind together
that confederacy, which, but for tips patriotism of
a Hancock and an Adams, would never have had existtsaco.
1 am proud as any citi/.cn. for whatever .NewYork
hat to be proud of. But when I recollect that
although we have heretofore done much, yet that we
are now faltering in a progress that has been one of .-onslant
triumph? I feel that Old Massachusetts will guin
the highest honor by that fum faith and steady perseverance
so necessary now to prevent the country from falling
from the course ol* high enterprise w hich it has hitherto
pursued. But the occasion dees not call forergument
in favor of internal imprevemonts so much as so
cial congratulation up >n the event we celebrate. I w ill,
with the permission of the company, read a letter, which
perhaps is the earliest authentic record to bo iound of an
arrangement, with a view to an improvement oi the internal
communication between N. York and Massachusetts.
It bears date, "fort James, (now the city ol N. York)
17th December, 1672,"just 169 years before the arrival oi
our guests from tho Bay Btate by a railway Journey of
eleven houts. Tho letter was written by Cel. Francis
Lovelace, than Governor of this colony, to the Governor
of Msssschusetts. [It snnounced Uisriacicd Mejesty'a
commands that the colon;, a should enter into a clo.e
correspondence with each other; and that to accomplish
that purpose, Governor Lovelace had established a poat
to proceed on horseback once every month to Boston,
allowing two week* for the journey and sn wpial time
for returning ] tVe may not, said the Governor, speak
disrespectfully of all this. The letter, simple as it is.Is
full or wisdom, rendered simple only by tho experience
and acquirem-ntsof 1 GO years. In the royal injunction
to the eoloniea to enter into an intimate corr- spon Jence,
ia found the germ of that policy?that mighty policy?
which has m do those provinces free ami Independent
9 ht s?the tirst movement uf|th<'nations towards constitutional
liberty! Aye, it might mortify statesmen to remember
that this first lessen upon internal improvements
enmeatn ns from the most di.-solute ix-riod in tin history
of tout moot dissolute monarch, Thai Ira the Second. if
to Uovernor Lovelace la long* the honor of conveyinir
his Majaaty's command* to tne colony of Ma*???hum tts
B?f, to c 1 ivate friendly relation* with New York, it
* rimtii me that ourgucit* on the present occasion muy
tie considered a* bringing to ti? the r?-*[>otise of the oi l
B*\ Siate; and if it has tmon long delayed, I think no
must all agree that it in satisfactory.

to show how little,he Slid' the gentlemen referred
to had had to do in the construction of this public woik.
It hat been an arduous woik ; but it hail been brought

herself. And as so much hat been sai l (continued
Mr. Q ) in pi aisc of tho Yankee*of New England,
1 know Is all ho pardoned by those present, if I avert
for one moment to what hat been done by Albany. This
city has borne au important part in Carrying forward

u, ! liavv lii-ar.l described. It wa* pretty haul work to
get over, hut there wat one littlo pannage left. It wai
?aiJ that iu the kingdom of 8pain. a proposition watouri
itatto<f to muku a caual from Home place to Madrid, an<]
that permission vmi asked of hia Catholic Majesty to
make it. llii reply was that if it wntthe will of the A1
mighty that a water communication should he there, hi
would h.i\ e maJe a rn , r for that purpose, but having
made none, he thought it would be the height of impiety
to make one. (Laughter) Now whin we came to
muiiiiiuiiia. u e had exactly the encouragement the
Spanish king wonted. Here were mountains presenting
insui moiintatile obstacles to a passage. But there win
one place Kit in the chain,Ju*t wide enough, u* it happened,
aud of th<'proper elevation. It se?me<] to bnve
hem made on purpose; und at length we came to
the opinion that the woild in general, and the county
of Berkshire in particular, were made with ev
press refer-nee to the Great Western railway.?
(liheers ) Wo got along pretty well through there
mountain,; hut whilu going on, plain sailing. we came
to a little kiook dividing New Yuik and Mustachesetts,
ami could get no further. The gentlemun Ironi
New York,(Col. Wehn) has alluded to what we have
done in sviichcratt. Now, air, let ne till him that no
witch ever crossed a running stream. I don't know
but it is so w ith the Dutch, hut I will siy lor the information
of the gentlem in, that though we have on longer
any old witches, and those we have, have given up
broomstick* and taken to locomotive?still so havesomw
witcln * in Massachusetts, that are said,by the pswsr of

Yankee. (1.aughter) Be that ns it may ? we got into

we could not but run alter them. (Great ,1 lUghter.) It
is said by the wise king of Israel that a good namu it
richer to he chosen than great riches. Now I don't
know that any body knows what kunl of a physical
agent he employed in building the temple; but this I
know, that in building the wi-tt-rn railroad,ft good name

railroad, I would say (if It were not fir our engineer)
that it ?v as nothing but C/n/d't play, (hnughtu.) But
it is done, and what are to he the results, no tongue can
tell. Those iron liar* Iht'.tNlenil from oua capital to the

of good feeling and good fellow-ship from this time forth

Love, Law aihI Physic,
Atihe .Marine Court, on Friday, a trial "canoe
oil " before Judge Sherman, in which all the
e-utcry?the secret mysteries?of love, law and
physic, were fully bought to view ; and which it
b conn < our duty to record. Of Cupid's movements
we have not much to say, the urchin having
resigned his claim in the premises to his tickle
half-brother and companion. Hymen, whom ho accuses
of causing pleasure and pain, health and
(iekntKf, as may suit his caprice, tb the uiany favorites
whom he confide? to his cure. Hut there
was a rich struggle for superiority between the
iiicfiihrrs of the " learned professions." The
young prnpoundor and expounder of Itlackitone
exerted all h:s eloquence to draw frniu the accomplished
physician his skill and knowledge, and
hurl theui at the plaiutifi*, (as Jupiter of old hurled
thethunderb >!t at /Gsculapius,) for the ssicuee he
displayed in the important work that he had taken
in hand.
It was an action brought by Dr. Peter F. Clark,
whose stately mansion is in itlcvcker street, near
the Bowery, against Amhr. e Rikeinan, a respectable
butcher, residing at No 5 Fifth struct, to recover
.>'100 for medical attendance upon Mrs.
Riktmati wife of the defendant- After the ca?c
fort piaiutill'had been stated by Mr I. B ShcpI
his opposing counsel, truly with "trumpet
t-ni ,ui and words of lire," proceeded to the defence.
The defendants in this suit are a young
c :|>; , re>pi-cte.l, beloved, and w irthy. Some
t r Ave years ago they exchanged the position
of i > i-r and beloved for that sacred tie,
1 Where bliss presides?where joys beguile?
Whsre all the charms of virtuu smile?
Where heart to heart pure throbhings beat,
l'rcpaied life's rsys or stoim< to meet.
ti ? " nia rrii.fl ? hu nninf-s* crowned their
*?'J ? ?rr
days unJ contentment mulled at their peaceful
board. Health presided over their domicil, and
c i and --orrovv were unknown to their abode. In
nr?e of time two beauteous children gladthe
hearts of their purents, rendering their
.1 and home still more endearing, and every
uing went on smoothly and happily as a marriage
bell, lint alas ! it tvas destined that there shonld
be a change. Sickness was to visit that late happy
' home, and professional mat practice, withaubsc1
quent tyranny and persecution, were to bear down
upon them with their pestiferous blight. The
learned counsel then proceeded to state his case.
In the month of September, ltilO, Mrs. Hikcinan
. was visited, particularly after rising in the morning,
with severe head aehe and sickness at the
. 'stomach, accompanied by a furred tongue aud nausea
in the mouth, as if "she had been eating soap''?
there was also a general swelling of the system,
and a derangement of tho vital faculties, JJrco.-n'
ing alarmed, and somowhal suspecting the eause of
t her trouble, she sent to the plaintiff*, requesting he
' should call and bleed he*, i'he Doctor went, bot
declined bleeding, saying she hid only a cold,
which had settled down in her abdomen, and she
must on no account be bled. He then ordered
t strong sweats of hotcatsip .eaandpowdcrs.ai.d.hot
flannels to be constantly applied, and caused her
stomach to be rubbed for four or five weeks with a
home liniment, composed of sugar of lead, vinegar,
spirit* of turpentin?, and eggs. She was reduced
very low by this means, auu nad to keep her bed
part of the time, only getting up to the lire to be
rubbed with thu liniment. Still her system kept
f glowing larger, and after she bad been treated in
i this way for nearly two months the Doctor repeat'
ed his declaration that she had a severe cold, and
that it had settled down in a " lump." lie continued
to g.ve medicine, and caused her to be rubbed
with the liniment, saying that the " tuiuonr" in her
| stomach must be dispersid About tho middle of
J- November she experienced that "life within her"
which left no douot in her mind as to the cause of
I her disorder, and told the Poctoi that she was in
i the family way ; but he replied that such was not
f the case?it was merely a movement of water?and
1 continued his treatment as before. A consulting
physician was railed in, to whnru Dr Clark stated
' that Mrs. Ilikeman bad billious remittent fever.
[ They continued to give her medicine and treat her
in this Wty, and then wondered that the sick
s stomach should continue. She frequently told the
1 Doctor that she was in the family way, but he anr
swered that she was not, for if she bad been so the
1 medicine he had given her would have produced
" abortion. Finally, the " gentle movements" could
no longer be m stakon for the movements of water,
j and, after weeks of unnecessary sullcring, the doctor
withdrew from the fir Id, leaving nature and a
i good constitution free to repair the ravages, pro.
duced by " a want of skill," on the person of Mrs.
K. In Kcbrniry licr child was Lorn, and bad cvi
' I dcntly roue its lull time, but bore marks ol the nic[
I dicincs and the treatment which the mother had
I received, and whirh had nearly been fatai to them
both The^hild, alt kvugh at present nearly eleven
, months aid, is hut little heavier than children tmia
a'ly arc at three or four, and will probably be
i weakly for life, while Mrs II.'s other two children
are remarkably healthy and active.
This, gentlemen, (addressing the jury ) is the
statemi nt of the case, li is for " these days of suffering?thvic
nights of pain," that we are called
1 upon to nay, and to pay c xtortionately. Not satisi
fied with exhibiting ignorance or wickedness, a
> paralh 1 to which has briright condign punshinent

heard from Dr. Clark. 1 would reduce a fever us
soon as possible. I do not think a medicine given
iu a remittent fever would destroy a child."
By . J, noR?There is a regulation of prices by |
the iMedical Society, from which physician* arc
allowed to deviate, according to circumstances.
Think* where a case is litigated, a physician
should have mora th.iu where it is settled in friendship;
supposes n dollar, or a do,lar uiul a half a visit,
to he about corn ot.
Or. Tavi.oh sworn?Doctor, yon have heard the
treatment in this case, do you suppose it to have
been correct, and according to the practice you
yourself would probably have pursued!
Answi r?Being a married feruule, I should have
been on my guard how 1 treated her; sickness ut
the storfiacli and headache arc common symptoms
of pregnancy; had I been culled, 1 should have investigated
the case further, and if 1 found it resulted
in pregnancy, should have been very particular
iu my treatment; should look upon any other
treatment as being highly euljable; had there been
any doubt, I should have resorted to the tethescope,
aud if 1 ascertained that a woman was
pregnant, I should have niodcrateJ uiy treatment; 1
should certainly not have treated her the same as
if she was not pregnant; it would not be good
practice to attend a pregnant woman for two or
three months, and doctor her for "water;" thinks
the plaintiff's saying the child was a lump, and
must be doctored and scattered away, to have been
very bad practice. [Wcnecd unt say that these
sentences are answers to questions propounded by
tho counsel; both sides, in general, being down upon
the witness at the same time.] 1 should have
' ascertained what the lump was, whether it was
dropsy, or abscess, or pregnancy.
(Question?Was there danger of using liniment,
such as this, in caNeof pregnancy !
Answer?If it was an activejliniment, I should
be afraid of its getting to the bowels and creating
abortion. Spirits of Turpentine sometimes acts
upon tho womb. I shoul 1 not have resorted to stimulating
medicines, unless the fever was excessively
severe. Doctoring lor an entirely different
disease from what the woman lias, may induce a
disease that was not previously in her system. Very
"? . Ilii 1H' .o.yUt I V?nuy ??!*) *
ders >uflicieutly powerful to scatter a tnnmr, might
do so; but 1 do not know of any pow ders that would
have sach an effect.
Cro*s txainirttd ?Headache and tick stomach are
common to bilious remittent fever. Thinks disease
night be produced by very active medicine, but do
not think that bilious remittent fever could ho so.
That results from miasma or poisun in the air. I
do not think it could be acquired in any other way.
Knows nothing about this case, hut thinks from
w hat he has heard in evidence, that if he were rallIn
< fomulp Ulith such svmi.Ium*. should think
her to lie pregnant There are certain points that
cannot be mistaken. ] can nay nothing about this
particular ca?e. IVai culled upon by iVlr Kikenaan
to testify. A physician can tell best about hie own
patients. Witness ie III y>am of ago. Ila? been
niue year* in the profession, and seven years in
practice.
Dr. Post sworn ?'Think* the evidence of Dr.
Taylor geucrally to be correct. Fever powders uro
euch as to create perspiration, and would not produce
fever. Hilton* remittent fever tu bes from an
impure atmosphere. Sick headache alone would
not ehnw bilious fever. With regard to hot fvrm,
ntations they may be mint-time* used in fever.
Persons might give cathartics in levers when not
pregnant, that would not be proper when they are
so. Powder* that have a direct tendency to produce
abortion, are not given in fevers. Thinks
that if other practice was resorted to.it ini^ht injure
the child and tliu mother.
Dr. Tibld sworn.?Did you attend Mrs. Rikemau
in her confinement 1
Answer?I did
Question?Had the child gone ita full timel
Answer?It had.
Question?Have you heard the evidence in this
case, and if so, state to the Jury what you think hi
relation to itt
Answer? My opinion agree* generally >ith that
of Dr. Taylor. 1 think, on visiting Mr*. Kikenian,
the. first conrte of Dr. Clark should have been to
ascertain the nature of her disease, and to hare
treated her differently Thinks >hc ymptomsthst
have been described, might have been produced by
medicine.
Question?You attended Mrs. R. in February,
when the was confined?what was her situation I
Answir?1 found her to he an exceedingly wellformed
woman, with ayood constitution.
Q'u stion?Have you h id much practice in cases
of this sort!
Answer?I have had a good deal of practice in
obstetric enset. Had charge of the lying in department
of the almshouse, and was with the pa
tienls l>< fore and nf er tliey wo c eMiifined. 1 think
the treatment of Dr. C lark was Imprudent. For
the few first months of pregnancy, it is somewhat
difficult of discovery, hu' when the child quickens
>t ia easily ascettaiovd if a phytirian is qualified,
aud t ike* pains, he can have no difficulty in
finding out, and if he gave medicine that would
he likely to pri duce abort! n, it coald not he good
practice. I think from the evidence that has hren
given,thai Mrs. Kikomnn did'nt show symptoms
of bilious fever; she would not have been able for
so long a time, to get up and go to the fire to be
..,1.1....i i,i,i m. mi hi hop h?i n rmilinid to hsf bed
Her symptoms were much more like those of pregnancy
tliiii ol fever. Riuieuus wi I not ulwaya
prevent sickness at (lie stomach; fh?*K ">??y ease it;
medicinea in fovera hav? a tendency to reduce the
vital powers, and toniea are afterwards given to
restore them. Do not think the treatment of Dr.
Clark to have been judicious.
Question?What reason hava you for thinking
M>1
Anauer?I think that Dr. Clark, having attended
this lody for five or ?ix weeks, whrn within two or
three months of her confinement, and still net know
that ihe was pregnant, but asserting that (he was
nut an, shews it. When a woman is in the family
way: her tongue ia generally crated, hut i: i.? n^>t
.ilwaj to.
(Question?Yon apeak very Confident, Doctor,
of the treatment in the case. Could not pregnancy
cftsily He mistabon for Cold or fever t
Anawer?I think not ; and no judicious physician
would treat n woman that was pregnant, by
rubbing Diem fnr three weeka and giving tb? u.
powder*.
Question? In auch cases how would you youraell
proceed 1
Answer?There are several way* of examining
a woman that i- pregnant. I would lav my hand o>i
h< r abdi men If, on doing ao, 1 found a tuiovur 1
I wonld aak her if she found a movement there

i- entirely fieefruiu any stain. We are glad ol the
btcaiise Mr. Cirinnell is m honorable merchant
anil no connection wit a pontic ti morals mis uee

The scenes described by (ilciitworth are most c<
rimts and instructive. Tiny ure specimens of "toti
depravity" licit nta.-t shock every per- m. Vet thes
pet so UK and their ae's vere defended by (lie Wa
street press, and llobert H. Morris, the honest Jt?
corder of \>w York, was lib-lied ten thousun
times, m every form, nil J then removed because h
would not screen the piye*Iayers. In the same ntovt
men', Noah and Lynch wore put upon the bcncl
contrary lothe charter of the city?lor what pnrpos
is now known well.
At another time when \y hive more room, w
shall give u few choice selections fro in these disclc
sure?, by way of showing to the world, the morals c
politics a mon 2 cert .tin cliqu-t ii-r . We have 11
room to d iy.
The'latter portion of t lien'worth's brochure i
filled with severe rem irks and allusions to Livvard
Curtis, Alderman Bcn.-on, and others, but we thin
w nltoui any force,or propriety, or good feeling. A
the connection that \lr. Curtis seems to have in th
matter, arises from his ctl'orts to save his friends,au
to prevent an exposuri?a very amiable feeling
however improper it may be to thn cause of soun*
morals and honesty in politics. Alderman lVnso
seem even to have acted a still more amiabl- pat
?and yet Glentworth is almost savage oil this kind
hearted Alderman. This is not right nor just.
Now the question arises, what will be the pr.icti
cal effect of these awful disclosures? Just nothin;
at all. The morals of politicians are at so low ai
ebb, tint these astounding facts will produce no re
stilt. Mr. Blatchford ought to be removed from tin
place lie holds as Receiver of the Commercial Bank
but such a tiling will not be dvtte. Glentwortl
himself, w ill sink iuto oblivion and disgrace, unles
h ' cornea lip, like a duck front a deep dive, in somi
olli' r party. Our honest opinion is that many of tin
whig leaders are shockingly corrupt?but that then
are leaders among the locofocos that can givt
Blatchford At Co. three points in the game o
roguery, and tueu beat them. lue loccl icos are ne

New Year's Dav, Calls, awd Temperance.?Saturday,
the first day of A. D. 1812, was one of the
loveliest and brightest days that ever ushered a New
Year into exigence. More hearts beat with delight
on seeing the sua rise up from behind Long Island,
than ever before in this great and happy city
Such a day conies almost as seldom as New Year's
day itself, and was not to be lost. We never saw
the streets so crowded with pedestrians, or more
thronged with vehicles, driving and dashing as ii
driven by steam, in the whole course of our lives
Every liou?e was thrown open for visitors?the ladies
app ared never handsomer nor happier, and the
richness of the display in ide was only equalled by the
richness of the day outside. Indeed, there appeared
to kt - u rivalry for brilliancy between the ladies and
sun.
We were sorry to see, in face of all this, so macn
intoxication in our streets. It seemed to us as if no
temperance societies existed. At broad noon more
respectably dressed young men were seen stagger
ing under the quantity of wine and liquor they hac
taken, than on any cue day for five years. And we
never witm ssad, in the same time, such an appear
ance of temperance. Many families had no wine
at all. and a larg- number had coffee and chocolate
for the purjx-s" of leo ning the consumption ?>r l>
qiiors S'iII there was no diminution in intoxica
tion and it even extended into the Mayor's office. Ii
consequence of the improper behaviour of many r
his visiters, by which the carpets were complete!;
ruined, he was compelled to close up and go horn
at one o'clock, and d prived many of the pleasur
of seeing hiin. Lord Morptih was among thr num
bt r.
These are lamentable facts. We were in hope
that the temperance cause w ould, ere this, have ex
tended its influence over thiscity, and given to ou
amusements and celebration a ra i mality w hich ha
bees for so long a period so much wanted.

Nf ver has there beensuch an exemplification <
(l the importance and value of party discipline, part
r_ organizition, ami party authority, as we have wit
nee-ed *ince the opening of Congress. An infiuit
j. ol labor, of annoyance, of perplexity, is saved b
)r the substitution of the dirtum of party for the exei
eise ot judgment, sound sense, and discretion.tf
When party discipline is perfect, there is no indiv
dual responsibility,no hesitation, no desire to eva;'
II questions of any sort. Every man in the rank
marches up promptly and with precision. There i
_ no complaint, no cavil, no dodging. The mandate
u of party, promulgated through the medium of ;
caucus, supersede the necessity of thinking or deli
berating. Nothing is required but bullheaded fide
(| lity. Everyman witoacknowledges fealty to hi
party, puts his conscience and Ills patriotism in thi
II hands of the leader, and yields a blind subservienc;
to his dictation. At the extra session, the whig
j were drilled and marshalled to the most per'e;
e state of party efficiency. Never was thpre a mon
solid phalanx,a more unbroken front. They voted
, to a mm, for Mr. Clay's bank bill, a measure ac
r knowledged, on all hands, to be utterly worthies
for all practical purposes?an absurd, incongruou
e scheme, without one redeeming quality in all it
provisions. But party tyranny predominated ove
,1 every consideration of principle, of expediency, o
() cl patriotism. Tlie bill was passed through bptl
houses,and only arreated by the good sense, integrity
s and independence ot the President.
I After executing all the behests of party, the whij
k members went home to their constituents. Fron
|[ thein they received a let-son, which opened thei
e eyes to the folly of many of their acts, and they re
j turned here to the regular session, disorganized ant
, broken up, as n party, without ah acknowledget
j leader?without a settled plan of action?withou
tl confidence in each other, and without n comtnoi
t purpose or object. Hence the confusion and unarch)
that lias prevailed up to the present time?henct
ill- doubt aHd hesitation manifested on nil hands.
Tiie revolt which line tjken place in the whii
,, ranks, in every section of the country, ha3 had iti
, effect on Congress, Members have begun to set
the necessity of thinking for themselves; and, i
possible, avoiding the political destruction whicl
must ensue, if the rash and headlong counsels o:
( Mr. Clay aru permitted to prevail. This necessitj
s imposes a large amount of lubor and responsibilitj
> ?and, as it is a new thing, it is not surprising tha'
there should have been, for u time, no decided tone
or direction to whig sentiment or opinion in Con
gress, 011 the lisca! scheme of the administration
At the extra session, there would have been nr
. doubt, for a single day, what would be the course
adopted. Ascertain the opinions or feeling of Mr.
Clay, and it was not necessary to enquire further
Bat the popular condemnation of whig policy and
measures, lias nearly destroyed the power ?f Mr.
Clay, and utterly precluded the idea of union or
harmony, or concurrence in the whig ranks. There
is neither zeal, nor concord, nor activity. The currency
question is the great measure of the session.?
' Upon this, Mr. Clay is indisposed to effective ac'
tion ; but it seems to be admitted that he can hardly
control a majority, even of the whigs, in either
' house. Blind as he may be to the will of the people,
they < annot shut their eyes to the state of the public
mind, nnd they will not incur the hazard of defeat!
ing the wise andjpatiiotic purposes of the adminis'
t rat i on.
I The views thrown out by Mr. Mangn.ti, in his vioI
lent tirade yesterday, are not entertained by more
tiisn six or eight members of the Senate, on the
whig side. There may be a coalition between the
i extremes of both parties, embracing a suiheient
number to defeat any scheme of finance, but there
- is a considerable poition of bo.li sides that will not
) be a party to any such factious combination.
The people desire to see this question settled
- They do not sympathise with the personal desirei
s of those who wish to keep up perpetual agitation
? in tli" hope that it may ultimately ensue to their owi

Mk >n Mrson's BxsrrriT ?Thisg'inilenian'd benefit
taki-s place to-night at the Park theatre, and Mile.
Kl?>ler, on this consideration, performs, und takes a
fiual adieu of her legion of admirers. We notice
on the bills, the announcement merely of Mile.
[ Elesler's appearance, without designating the actual
reason, namely, on the occasion of Mr. Simpson's
benefit. The only cause we can ascribe for
this blunder is, that Mr. Simpson withholds his
name, knowing that the name of the i/<m*ru?r
will prove >)uite siiflicient to draw a crowded
house, and at some future time he will appeal to
the public on his own behalf, thereby killing
two birds with one stone. It is an undoubted fact
however, that Mile. Elasler consented to appear lor
the benelitof the management, and not in cotnpli.
attce wit* any solicitation, as the hills say, and justice
and gallantry -houhl have prompted Mr. Simp,
son to a far different course front that he has pursued.
141<r vuun .u^ oara will explain the mystery :?
Mile. K*s*v Kntim present* hrr compliment* to the
public, ?ni\ ?Uriu ? to state that hor appearance at the
I'm k on Monday (tki* evening) ji not in comt.lianco with
any "solicitation*, as incorrectly announced in the
lulls, hut meant as a compensation to the management
lor any losses arising from tUu shoit postponement of
her engagement through illness, for which she receives
no remuneration.
A, run Hoc**, Jan. 2.
Thus it appears, that while tMU*. Elrnler has act.
rd on this occasion with that generosity which has
rendered her proverbial ia this countty, there has
been nn unmanly attempt, on the part ot the management,
o withhold justice from her. The audience
ought to call tor Mr. Simpson, and hear hisexplanation
for such conduct. It is a notorious fact
that great gmtUilf occurred at the theatre, owing
to th- illness of th* ilan?ru?e at the commencement
of her engagement. The company received no salary
for the two nights the theatre Was closed, and
uow that Mile. Elssler comes forward and performs
gratuitously,to insure the management against lo.-s,
it is but a poor subterfuge for it to announce lo-rap
pearance as the result of "solicitations
There has been n disagreement between Mile J Ussier
and Moos. Sylvain. Mons. Martin, whom we
consider a far superior dancer to the former, goes
with her to the Havana We are not surprised at a
i
told hi ii that he was endure d onjy_v.14t.of compliment
to Kls: ler.
< tn Wednesday next Mile. Elssler goes to Philadelphia,
and thence embarks for the Havana, lfcr
career in this country has been marked by unexampled
suec-ss, and wherever she has appeared, she
lias done some chari'able ac ion, which has increased
her popularity. She has probably cleared nearly
one hundred thousand dollar* by her engagements in
the principal cities of the United States and Cuba, a
result certain to revolutionize theatricals in Europe.
Ilcr success will i-tunulate the great stats of Europe
to shoot from their present spheres?and soon we
may expect 'o see Tagltoni and Cerito, the two remaining
graces, tripping ttgaily across the broad
Atlantis* uitrl in fK*<ir f rain (4rio I? iiKint A Ikovtav
zi, and Lablache, the empire of ?or
We hardly suppose any of the dr vill be as
successful as Fanny, in point of r'Mtleraiion,
from the circumstance th '->
lumbus ol the dance, who disco,
woild, and has taken it in all its freshnet.
tain it is, that they will realize more in two? art u
America, than they could trt ten years in Europe.
The fixed star system in Europe is on the verge of
explosion, instance the case of Rubini. lie had
been giving exhibitions at all the chief cities on the
continent, und at the last account, had enraptured
ihetlueen of Spain with his astouishing vocal powers.
I .it ham Theatre?As we expected, this theaatre
w.t- crowded to suffocation on New Year's
night. lew than four ladies went off into fainting
fii . J Heaven know? how many more before
the performance? closed. The house was so full,
that there was scarcely room for respiration. Tonight
Thorite comes out with Mazeppa, Kirby enacting
the hero. It will rather take the benches by
surprise if the house is not crowded.
Oi.vmpic ?A very full house congregated here on
New Year's night, to wish Mitch'll a happy New
Year. At the close of the performances, a wreath
was thrown on the stage, which immediately encircled
Mitchell's head. Ho was very much overcome
by this incident,and created a roar by the opeiati?n,
among the audience, which almost carried off the
roof. Mitchell i? "a very funny fellow," as poor
Power was called in " Rery O'More."
Bowr.av Amphitheatre ?Hundreds went away
unable to get seats at this arena on New Year's
night Fainting was the order of the night, and a
great demand lor Cologne water. Several ladies
followed the example of sonic of their sex at the

Federalism^was completely reinstated throughout
Mexico, inviting bun to r. turn to the Mexican

of Tobisco. Don Fernandez was
also the bearer of several valuable p-esrnts from

Bandajr, Jan. 9?6 P. W,
Yesterd ly being a holiday, no business was transacted
and through the week, aa is usually the case, but little
was Joi.e in a general way.
The balk Tennessee, from Sisal, has $17,900 in specie.
7S Spanish and 125 Mexican doubloons.
hm. .. ?n- j ? ..i;.. nf ihf different Legis
a lie mail, lu-uaj, lu? _
turei, on the subject of H ate debt* and Bank resumption*.
hi Mary laud the assessment under the State tan
law ii going forward. As far a* i? yet ascertained, they
areas follows:-Bahin>ore city, (68,170,612; Frederick
county, SIP,081,867; Carroll county, #,831,132; Kent Ce
$3 630,069; Talbot county,$4,7o9,147; Queen Anue'scouuty,
4,336,763? Total (106,628^80. It is stated that the
remaining counties in the State will, it is expected, bring
it to above 200 mi 11 ions, which at the rate of taxation, will
produce about (400,000. (600,000 is the amount which
will become necessary to raise, to pay interest on the
public debt, &c. It is to be hoped that the banks in that
State will shortly be compelled to resume specie payments.
Notwithstanding their disgraceful insolvent
condition, they still go on makiug dividend* among the
stockholders, although they tell the unfortunate billholder,
that they cannot pay their debts to him, and
consequently if ha waut* money for their promises, he
must get it shared at live per cent at a brokers. The following
dividends have been declared:?The Merchant's
Bank of Baltimore a half yearly dividend of three per
cent. The Western Bank of Baltimore two and a half
per cent, for the last half year. The B-altimore and
Rappahannock Steam racket Company seven per cent
for th? l*st year. On the 1st of January, 1841, the capital
and circulation of these two banks stood as fol.
lows:?

These dividends, made when the bank* refuted to pay
their promises on demand, are a direct plunder on the
public. They profess not to bo able to pay their liabilities,
beruuge they divide the money that should be appropriated
to that purjiose among themselves.
In the Tennessee Legislature resolutions have keen
offered to compel from the banks a statement of their affairs
and to explain why they cannot resume speciepayments
on the 1st of July next. . There is some hope in
that quarter that resumption may be brought about by
that time. It is also stated that the Bink of Illinois is
about to reduce its discounts and circulation, preparatory
to an eftsrt at resumption.

specie of the Alabama Banks, in December, as compared

The banks have recently been purchasing exchange
and cotton to meet the iubries!, payable here and in DonJon.
This operation is performed1 only by increasing
the amount of the depreciated currency afl oat, and cannot
be contiuued. It is highly probable that $811,000
due next year cannot ba met, and an explosion will then
take place.
The Delaware 8t Hudson Canal Company has recently
issued to their stockholders a circular, which they meant
houlJ la sec ret, in order to allay the present feeling
among them, which points to the necessity of opening
an investigation into the manner in which the company
has been conducted. It is an undoubted truth, that the
capital stock has,been issued and said both to pay debts
and dividends. In relation to this, the circular allude I
to, contains the following paragraph :
First, then, as to alleged division of capital.?It may
be observed that the company has been paying regular
annual dividends for several years past; and yet,during
the satnetimo it has extinguished a large debt; which
had bscii created by temporary loans,taken upto provide
the requisite funds for the prosecution of its business,
dhisot itself is suthcicnt to establish the absurdity of
thechtrge. But again, after paying the dividend made
in June last,there remained on b ind a balance of accumulated
profits, amounting to $331,466 32.
Most of the stockholders have the back returns ol the
Company ; by turning to them and comparing the statenur.ti
they w ill find the following items of liability
1832. 1939. 1841.

Last March the company omill'd in its annual report,
for the inftrmalitn of the stockholders, the amount of its
capital and liabilities. The amount of interest paid
ho wcver, as compared with those of the previous year,
show s that the debt was reduced $70 00) only. How now
tends the aasortion ef these people, that they had paid
their debt* by their probts 1 Their debt has been reduced
but $60,000 sinee 1832, and their liabilities lias increased
$400,00# ! and are at this moment constantly increasing.
The shave paragraph in the next place states that last
June they held a surplus of $331,400. Turn now back
to the report of March, 1939,on page 0th; there Is a statej
ment that the surplus proflt was then $332,313, hon ing
f a diminution in the urplue of $60,807! From those facts,
' it is very evident that had not the capital stock been
mcreaseJ, an J part of the surplus expended, the debts of
the company woull now be $1,70'J 000. What has been
done with the money 1 Outot an increase of $66.-, OOD in
its Capital, the company have paid but $62,000of debt.
How mucho) that money has been expended in dividends 7
' A femi-ofticial report of the company states that $2 060,.
000 has hoeu invested in canals, boats railroads, village
i lots, coal lands, h",. This amount corresponds w.th tho
report of 193#. The value of that property may b discovered
from the fict that tho canal cost $'2,269.283,and
the railroad $337,187. Last year the repairs and super
inteiiilcncecost $162,312

compauv about five dollars and ninety c-nta for every j
ton of co il they delivered at ltondout. Of course, the
Ccni|mny have been forced to make sales at a heavy lout, |
as their sales for the aeven yeara, ending ISIS,did not
avernge $4 AO per ton. The Ion in the coal buaiuesi ot i

Total loas. $700,1^4
In a former report, the company allow that the coal
cost them $6,36 pertnn, but state that it was owing to
extensive repairs, " tho high price of labor, Ac." The
printed return of last March, states that the value ol the
coalon hand March, 1940, was $91,173, the sab s during
the year, $633,247, and the value of the coal on hand at
the close of the year, was $174,336. In that year the
coal mined waa 143,000 tons. The increase in the value
of the coal on hand la $90,003, making with the sale
$713,310, at all that the company gets for the 148,900 tons,
which i* equal to an average of $4,80 cents per ton,
showing a lossoi 46 cents per ton. All these facts are
taken from the reports of tho compauy made at <1 liferent
periods. Last March, at we have stated, the companymade
no report of their capital and liabilities, and notwithstanding
the recent rumors, they have again omitted it
in the " recent circular," and also in "the pulls" that
daily appear in tho Wall afreet papers. Tho managers
must understand that, since the famous letter of Mr. Biddie
en retiring from the management of the U. S. Bank,
the assertions of company directors have but very little
facts and figures.
