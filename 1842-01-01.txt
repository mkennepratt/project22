.. in started forcm versatinn, without the question be[hj
ing asked, " What does Bennett say V' Allow me
f> to say, in cold earnest, that from no other source
t1' can we obtain the same amount of useful and pleasiug
information. I have, therefore, been induced
V to ask a place in one of yoar columns fora short cor? ?
respondence, the object of which is, to give to your
numerous readers, in other sections of the country,
ne some idea of how things are going on in a Southern
!' town, which ranks as third, in point of importance,
M' in the State of Georgia.
In the first place, 1 may premise, that nur geographical
position is at the " Falls of Coweta on
^ the Chattahoochee river ; a bold stream that rushes
down from the mountain- in the uorthern part of the
of State, and is here precipitated overaledgcof rocks
in most beautiful and romamic eoufusion. Navigate,
tion is of course impeded, and to this circumstance
we owe our advantages in poiut of trade. At the
BC" last spring fresket, tne river rose to within a few
l, j feet of the level of the city, and the powerful curing
rent commenced making a breach in the bank, which
has continued to be widened at each successive rise
',11" of the water, until fears are begiuning to be euteron
tained,that,at some future day,the fairest portioo of
bK< the city will be swept away. Six or eight acres of
nk ground at the upper end ol Broad street have nlrearrd
dy disappeared, and should another freshet occur
on- soon, several bouses will have to be removed or go
wo oil'in company with the land. You cannot imagine
ire, how sadly the appearance of our place has been
? marred by this untoward freak of the waters.
to( Society here is of rather a queer order. We have
be resident among us, agreater number of Judges and
ex Judges, Generals and ex Generals, Members ol
Congress aud ex-M. C.'s besides Culonels, Majors,
Doctors, and Ksquires, than can be found in auy
(l. town in the Union, containing no more than foui
600 ky* Um rasJlcalfaTalty for reiiefftom Roptiira.Vvioocslt.

sold here annually, bringing aver a million of dot

in operation here are both in a state of ingloriou
suspension, and are really doing us great harm bi
preventing a better currency from finding way t<
us, which would soon be the case if they were ou
of the way. The Phetiix Bank and the old Ineuranci

The party was hard run for an available candidate
and forthe want of belter timber many of thetn had
resolved to go for Samuel Medary, the editor of the
Statesman ; but since Shannon has consented to take
the nomination, there can be no doubt ol the latter
being the man- The convention to make the nomination
will meet on the 7th or Hth of January.
To-morrow, 27th, there is expected a great turnout

l!y her we have received intelligence from Santa
Mrirtlia to the 27th, and Carthagena to the 30th of
November.
The new British Consul General, Mr. Stewart,
had arrived at St. Martha with powers from his government
to effect a reconciliation between the Federalists
aud Constitutionalists. Cin the lltli he had
an interview with Gen. Corniona, and immediately
left for the head quarters of President Goran, at
Chivinana.
On the 30th alt. Carthagena was invested with a
force ol loOl) to 1500 men. Great sickness prevailed
among them. The town was well supplied with
provisions, enough for the next six months. An
American brig, the America, from New York, iiad
arrived there under convoy of the Dolphin and increased
the supply. Vety little apprehension was
felt in Carihagena of falling iuto the hands of the
enemy.
The 3d divitdon of the Constitutional troops was
on its march from the interior to the relief of the
Carthageniuns. The Federal sniadron, as the blockading
fleet was called, was oil Carthagena, and the
Constitutional squadron was inside the harbor.
The brig New Grenada, that once traded between
this port and New Grenada, was seized by General
Corniona aud made into a brig of war- She was an
American built vessel but sailed under New Orena
| da colors. Her agents in this city were I.verette ?
i Battelle.
The Dolphin has on board two prisoners charged
' with the crimes of piracy, robbery, and attempt to
murder on board the brig Cicero, of Philadelphia,
s last July, the particulars of which we have before
" given.

forgeries on the Mechanics' and Chemical Banks,
the particulars of wh^cli ?vere published in the New
York Herald on the '20th inst, was arraigned for examination
before Justice Purker last evening, but
owing to the absence of some testimony, the final
examination of the case was postponed until ten

name of the person from ichom he says he received the
checks.
Stii.i. thbv Come?During the forenoon yesterday,
a hoy named William Browu, who peddles
pencils, quills, Arc., was accosted in the President's
Hotel by a person whose name will be given in our
next publication, and requested to take a check
signed by Kussell C. Clover, for $241 to the Manhattan
Bank, get it cashed, and he would meet him
at the Custom house. The hoy preseuted the check,
but the teller suspecting it to be a forgery, slopped
it, and requested two of the porters of the bank to
follow him where he Hated the man was in waiting.
The forger suepecting all was not right, was
amongst the missing, and the boy was taken to the
police office to make the complaint Officer Uuthwaite
was selected to perform the duty, und, walking
down the street, they met the person who gave
the check to the hoy, and he was immediately arrested.
The examination last evening fully proved
his identity, not only by the boy who presented the
check, but by a boy who is engaged as bar tender,
who saw him at the time he gave the check to
u_ i .l, ir..

Ghamue ok Fraud.?Lewis M. Morrison, the keeper
of a clothing store in Chaiharn street, near Duane,
was arrested yesterday on the complaint of a
black man, named diehard Anthony, who charged
him with endeavoring to cheat him in the sile of a
pair of pantaloons. Anthony stated that he entered
the store of Morrison, and purchased a pair of new
caiteiinere pantaloons lor SI, andoiVered a ?5 note
in payment. Morrison gave him u AS note to get
changed, and when he returned with the money, reserving
one dollar for himsell, a pair of second hand
pantaloons, patched on the scat, and otherwise
worn, were presented to liini by Morrison, instead
of those he had purchas-d. Anthony refused to
take them, and demanded the money lie had given
him (or the first pair. Morrison refused to give either
the money or the new pantaloons, and was liaally
atrested, and inf default of bail, committed to prison.
We understand that this is a common trick
among some of the second hand dealers in thisoc
lebrated street.

family follows him in a few weeks from England.
On Monday next S.r Charles dines with Mr. Bueha- .

The Firemen's Benefit.?Fanny's La?tSpeech.
Last evening the Park was crowded from pit to
dome. It was the Firemen's Benefit. " London
Assurance" was played and well played. Fanny
Kls3ler danced in her usual style. She was then
called out, and spoke the following speech, as taken
down by our corps of reporters:?
Ladies and Gentlemen : How many nights of the
closing ^year 1 now recall with wonder!?but this, the
iHbi oi uii, i" inu ui mi?ivr mrrc is ? picssuic
beyond serving one's calf?the pure jay of benefiting
others. A good action has been done to sight; to you
be the credit?to me, the satisfaction ol having worked
in the cause. You have this night lighted up a flame of
gratitude to the Widow's heart, that all the Firemen of
New York could not extinguish. Let itnevtr go out.
Should and applause followed this, that carried
part of the roof off the theatre?and to-day the carpenters
at an early hour had just finished putting it
on.
Faubt Elssi.er, plays for the last time here, on
Monday next at Simpson's benefit, und then takes
passage from Philadelphia to Havana. Her engagement
haa been profitable enough?but not so much
T jfl of the first year. If her sister Thereae
a come ou.,*_ -mild have made a second brilliant
career hrough the country, '--.has danced ^a. I
luitouely to three bent tits here, besides giving nrav*. !
money in charity.
Mrs. Scttor, the vocalist, is in Havana by this
time?so are Borghese, Statuti, Antognrfii and
other Italians, belonging to the opera. They all
perform in Havana previous to the arrival of Fanny
Els-ler.
Mr. Braiiam, the s"dt um*ter of song, is here,
giving coiuM'tio. He is under engagements to make
a ahort visit to Boston, Albany and Providence. He
will then return and go south as far as New Orleans.
Mr. Brahum has been eminently successful.
Naoei., the great violinist is on his watery way to
New Orleans. lie will play there and then go to
Havana. Herwig was at Philadelphia at our last
accounts.
Vocal Dxbutaktes.?We understand that two
very accomplished drbutanles in music and song, are
preparing to make their first appearauce in a short
time. Their names are Mary and Roeina Shaw.?
Some years ago, *they sang here?but were then
mere children. Mary Shaw is II years of age. Rosina
is 10. and boih are just bursting beautifully into
bright womanhood. It is said their voices are highly
cultivated?possess great power and flexibility, and
that their debut will make a sensation in the musical
world.
Mrs. George Josrtrs has written us a long letter
abont Mr. George Jones' affairs. The letter is affectionate
towards her husband, and exhibits a
feeling that merits respect. Mrs. George Jones mv
feel perfectly easy. Her request shall be

for consideruttonk
Resolved, Taut the Secretary of War be directed to in- .
form the Senate what it the present number of cadeta
in the military academy at West Point, from each State 4
and Territory ol the l uion.and the Dittrict ol Columbia, 81
what regulation, if auy, exists in the War Department t)
respecting the appointment of Cadeta, ao aa to apportion tv
them among the aeveral Statea ; whether the whole in
number of appointments haa at any time exceeded two ft
hundred and fifty, and if ao, at what tuna or time*. And p
whether when a vacancy haa been occaaioned in the '
cerpa of cadeta, from any cause, a aucceaaor haa been
uuiiormily ap|<ointed in the tame Congrrasional district *
from whice hia predecessor bad been elected. 8]
Mr Graham asked that the resolution might be
considered at present. t)
Mr. Sevier wished it to be over, as he wouid p
have an amendment to ofier to it. n
The resolution was laid over under the rale.
Midshipmen in the Navy. h
Mr- Barrow submitted the lollowing resolution (or n
consideration. tl
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Navy be directed ,
to communicate to the Senate a list of the names of the k
midshipmen appointed from the 1st day of January, 1837,
to the iioth December, 1841; and a statement showing the
places ol uativity of ail such midshipmen; and also their n
places of roaideuce at the time of their appointment. t'
Mr. Kino said that this information was furnish- J!
ed to Congress annuully by the Secretary of the '
Navy, and he thought it useless to go to the.e*p?nise *"
of having it printed in a separate lorni.
Mr. B.vsRoweaid he wished to have the aggregate ,
information, in a tabular form lor the purpose of
comparison, and basing legislative action upon it. .
The resolution was then adopted- p

_The President pro tern prenented a letter from j
Messrs. LSfair CC Kivpp, in reianon 10 me prim mg ui 0

The letter states that the compendium of the cen- c
sub is now being printed by Blnir fe Hives as prin- y
ters to the last Congress, and Thomas Allen, under j
dillerent and contradictory ordersol the Secretary n
of State; and stating that if Congress does not take a
some steps in the matter they will be involved in a r,
useless expense of some sixty thousand d ollars. a]

The Pmcbidext pro few. laid before the Senate a c
message from the President of the United States, w
transmitting an answer of the Secretary of State to p
a resolution of the Senate, inquiring whether any tl
propositions have been made to, or submitted by the h
British government relative to a mutual right of w
search, and stating that no proposition has been w
made by either of the governments to the other on ci
the subject to which the resolution refers. ol
The mil for the relief of the Selma and Tennessee V

Sfcond Dat's Debate ox the New FiscAmtv? ^
Development of M*. Clav'b Views, bv his jj
Mouthpiece?Vioi.ext Denunciation. j,
Mr. Maxoum resumed the debate this day on h
the President's projrt of a Board of Exchequer, and e'
said he desired to he indulged in the liberty of mak- hi
ing a few observations, but he should occupy the tl
attention of the Senate a very short time. He had tl
not come to the Senate Chamber yesterday with tl
the design, nor did ~~T" ,k,- li
tion of attempting anything like a critical or mi- di
ante examination of the tremendous/>rq/W wh'-k
had been propose.'1 to them by ,h" "ut "I
ue\irou), inasu.urh a. g??a ftorts had un- fi
m msiiuiianij been made to impress upon the pub- cl
ic mtpd the importance and the advantages of the ?'
tremendous scheme which had been so admirably h
concocted by the Treasury department; he was o
desirous, representing the views of no person or b
party, but confiding in his own judgment alone, he t
was desirous, be said,'at least, of setting his opi- p
nions in contrast with those whe had declared h
themselves favorable to the measure; and he would e
repeat that in anythinu which he should say on this s
occasion, he was mil h ne unocniouu a* re- u
presenting any interest or clique, or party, o
within that body or otherwise. He had o
especially abstained from consulting or ex- r
changing opinions upon the subject, as was f<
usual with the different parties composing that r
body; because, looking at events which had re- s
cently passed, and admonished by that retrospec- t
tion, he Imd determined to let by-gone* be by- r
gones; and looking only to the effect to be pro- a
duccd by lha proposed scheme, and totbecousc- t
quences which would inevitably flow from it, he t
had determined to be guided tiy the dictates of 1
his own judgment i:i the course'which he thou''' f
take in rvgard to it- If any thing could beaj'0 " T
plished in the present exigency toward-. ?TI*" ''

country groans, he would be the.', Prow!">tc

it. Upon the subject of Rprobable t<

legrnflljy ^ cn with consummate c
"5... "iSwith great labor, and it received on all ti
?the highest commendations and praises, it
^Vocceding, as it avow edly did proceed, from a ti
mind of superior ordtr, one of the very first in the c
whole Republic. But humble as his own abilities 1!
were, immature as he was in criticism, he would t<
nevertheless venture te (filler from the opinion ex- fi
pressed by his honorable friend from l'ennsylva- *
nia, (if he would permit him to call him so,) and tl
from the Senatdr frem South Carolina, than whom c
there was no man in the Republic better able to o
form a iust criticism lie believed that, so far b
from its being that perfect and incomparable docu- n
mi nt which was so universally admitted, and be- a
lieved, it was remarkable for nothing! except its t
utter want of originality. A?8 further, without f
intending any thing like criticism, he must ba per- *
mitted to fay that he looked upon it as in the h>gU- 1
est degree defective ; that its dedustions arc a
illogical; thgt its conclusions are vagne and (
inconsecutive; and that the errors with I
which it abonnds arc abrupt aud palpable, t
Then there it the production of a great t
min i, of a giant intellect, which bat been i
in the public theatre of the country for the last thir- <
ty years; a prominent actor, and who is identified
with the great party in the couatry, the glorious I
party of the American world, and designated a* the |
greatest effect of which the human mind is capable
; wonderful to be told after all the elaboration
f which the subject has received from so high a
sonrce, notwithstanding the power of intellect,the
s energy af mind, the ferca of party principle and ini
telligence, all concentrated upon a fsmilinr subject,
it has turned out to be a complete failure, an abor..
tion. It is like an attempt to unite the sources of
J the Nile and the Ganges, it is incompatible with
r. the nature of things. And he wouiu nere say is
hi* home friends that the course which they had
e taken on this occasion, was one which did them
honor, and entitled them to the respect of the publie.
lie would be most ready and williug to
" co-operate with those gentlemen in getting
up something in lieu of this scheme which should
0 answer the expectations of the country, and at the
same time be free from those objectionable qualities
which rendered tho proposed plan to him at
.. least so completely odious. But he looked on it
" rather as a matter to bo ''esired than one of practiIn
cab lity He hoped, however, there were none so
* poor, so grovelling or so base, as to do this thir*
e- rererencc They had not, as yet, heard it
eated or defended on tbat floor, and he hope"
01 would not. Was it not obvious that with merer

Frliln y, Dec. 31?0 P. M
The transactions at the Stock Board have been lai
and prices have generally gone up, under the poculli
heavy dema.i'1 for delivery to-day. Delaware It Hud
rose 1} ; Indiana i't, 1 percent.; Illinois 6's, lj ; Har
ll ; Stonington, 1 per cent; Canton, { ; Bank of C<
meroe is quoted 83 a 84, div idend 3 per cent. off.
Messrs. Stebbins and Mc A lister, who failed recon
in their obligations to the State of Illinois, have this i
resumed their payments, and taken their places at
Board.
1 The transaction with the State of Illinois has b
I nearly settled. It appears to have been entirely mists
r ogement from llrst to last, and may be briefly recous
I as follow. ?The State had in July no means to med
- liabilities then duo, and the come- ssiouer was obli|
r te borrow the money on the best terms he could, ml
" IN flnStly arranged with the hqusc of Suhtolns and i
\ Alister, stock brokers, that the* should prtcurt and 1
{ him fMI^OO on a pledge of isoieoo of bonds, being at
a rate of 40 cants on the <follsp? 'By th(, termg of thi< (
i" tract Messrs. Otebhins k dt'Alister were to procure
money, a Clear admission on their part, that they did
L . haye 11 toJpnd,ont|tit of the commissioner that hekr
B they*W4rs to gel Igem some other source, and that by
a nsa of the bonds, Which he delivered to them before
it recaivedhis money And the contract contained no
r atrictien against their hypothecating them. In the
f qjiel it appears thst Stebbiss & M'A lister did hy pothei
' them, bat failed to raise as much for the commissions
thay agreed to do. The State, on its part,failed to redi
B the bonds at the ejptra'iou of the time. The bonds I
fallen very heavy in th. market, and the house failei
b The commissioner taking advantage of the fact, that
hadnst received quite alihe money agreed upon, app!
I for an injunction, to pmvent innocent third partie
^ wlvm the bonds had beer hypothecated, from dispos
!? of ham. That injunction was most unjustly granted,i
g hai the market price of the bonds been sufficiently h
to cover the bonds at the time, would Have b
>f a irttter of serious loss to the parties. The c
l" misaoner then called a meeting of the holder*, andm
e a proposition, which we believe has been agreed uj
II as foiows The holders to deposits their bonds w
the 'iust Company,and to get from the receiver a rec
i, for number of bonds. The State is then to pay
maclasithas received, (lap,000, within'30days, to bt
videdpro rata among the holders. The parties will t
get, i the State keeps the contract, mors than they co
get b( selling the bonds. The injunction has now h
. dissolved, ami Stabhins k M'Alister, being released fi
the list lities, have reiumed the payment of their ot
en?Cgetient* and are now doing business at usual. 1
* whola tiousaction La*, however, a very suspicious
1 about it.
1 Thernha* been a fair business doing in billi for I

which,aith the scarcity of money,has tended to dec re

r One reason ior the decreased demand for bills is
t far t, th3t so many of the States have failed to provide
their interest. There will probably be $1,000,000 less 1
warded than usual for this purpose. Specie is in ti

jr. In relation to the debt of Maryland, the following l<
Is; passage from the Message of Governor Grayson, will *
lr' afford a full explanation &
The nature and extent of otar pecuniary embarrass- ^
in. ments are so well understood, that it ia only necessarv. r
"gt at the present time, to notice the new aspect which the'y 1
rp. have assumed lince the leit session of the Legislature.? ri
The law, then passed, for assessing and taxing the whole i
ia- property of the State, was intended to provide a perm a j
nent revenue, of sufficient amount to pay the interest of &
the publio debt punctually aa it became due. But aa It A
RR waa known that aoae time must elapae before the pro- 141
ceeda of the tax could be collected and paid into the J
nt. treasury, the Commissioner ol Loans waa authorised to *
ate borrow Ave hundred thousand dollars, for the purpose of g,
(h, supply ing the deficiency in the revenue for the present _
>u- year. Loans were obtained, principally from the banks, d
Li- to the amount of about four hundred thousand dollars, n
of which enabled him to discharge the interest of the pub- ~
106 lie debt on the first of July and the first of October ; but ^
'or it was impossible to borrow a sufficient sum for the next <
aa- quarterly payment ; and 1 regret to say that the State is n
ny without the meant of paying the intciest which will be
>m, come due on the first of January. It will be understood, 1<
ap- however, both athomeaud abroad, that the Legislature, V
>n. in laving a permanent tax for pay log the interest of the _
ied public debt, and in authorising a loan lor supplying the j
iv- temporary deficiency of the revenue, did all that was ?
ne then in their power to comply with the obligations of
[th the StateJ The assessment returns have not been receivrt
ed from all the countios, and the amount of taxable proIts,
pertr in the State is not yet ascertained. It will probaide
bly fall short of the general estimate, and in that case a ,
Jr. higher rate of taxation, than is provided for in the bill of
re- last stasion, will be required to meet the increasing de- b
rst manda on the treasury. The public debt is bow fifteen 1
in millions two hundred and thirteen thousand dollsrs, of
w- which about ten millions may be considered aa bearing ?
re- on the State. ^
e*' In relation to the Baaksjhe haa the following a
^ The banksof this State have persisted so long in refu- jj
snl sing to redeem their notes, that there is no reason to ex- 4
pcct that they will return of their own accord to the o
,w path marked out to them by their charters. It is now a
erB' question for the Legislature to determine how muchlon si
8rr it'ey are to be permitted to disregard the laws of the
yija State and the rights of the community.
iey The opinion may atill be entertained, that the State
lnd hanks can never be properly regulated without the'aid
Yfl of a National Bank ; and that, at thsirlpreamit condition
,et is attributable to the want of such an institution, ho re- J
' medy can be provided by State legislation. A reference
_ ta the banking system ofEugland, will show how far a
" great mouled institution, connected with the government,
haa had the effect of limiting the nudnber, or rel
gulating tha issuea of local and private banks.
