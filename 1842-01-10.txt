W YORK, MONDAY M(
nrdlml College of the New York University
Mr. Bewrktt:?
Yon were liberal enough to insert ray commanti
upon the N. Y. Medical College, and, but for th<
many professional engagements which crowd upot
me, I should have replied before to the queriei
contained in your remarks upon the article. I now
append your remarks:?
44 Rkmirki.?Pi ay, what does the 'friend and pbysi
ciau'Wriitl? We do not understand exactly the nature
ot Ul olj ttious. ('an he fpHif himself ?'
Individually, the * friend and physician" wants
nothing,?he is neither a teacher nor does he aspire
to that honor, but as an educated physician be desires
that they who assume to be the instructors ol
vnur youth, should conform to the demands of the
age in all that pertain* tothe department* they profee*
to teach. We are the avowed advocate and
friend of the institation in question, and oesire that
naught ihi'uld be "*et duwu in malice.'* The nature
of our "objections" can be readily 4>re?ented. In
1S37, the Council of the N. Y. University, in accordance
with the want* of the profession, designed
establishing a Medical Department; and created
some fifteen or twenty protessorships. Many n|
the professors were appointed; but, from the unwieldy
character of the machiue, it could n6t be
put in motion. Subsequently, one or more of the
presentable faculty attempted a new organization
upon a more contracted basis. '1 he result you have
sr.en. They advertised to the profession that they
had established a great National Institution, and
invited not only the support of our city, but of the
entire country. The atiove (acts will enable us to
make a comment upon the two plans, so as to d..veloj.e
an answer to your last cr.quirv
The conception of the Council in 1&57, was doubtless
based upon a proper estimate of the vast ramifications
of the medical profistion; but from the
existing mode of iustruction (however correct
theii views may have been) the plan was Utopiau.
The period of mediral education could not allow < I
so extended and diffuse a curriculum. Let it net
be urged that these views will maintain against
the suggestion which we shall offer; for while this
error was irremediable on the one extreme; the
error upon the opposite, although remediable,
might, if persisted in, be equally latul. In avoiding
Scylla, do not strike upon Cbarybdi*. The error
of which we complain, is, that in contracting,?
the Council of the University have overlooked the
wants, uay the immediate demands of the profession.
That we are not peculiar in this view, wc
point you to every well established and reputablt
medical school in our country Where do yoii
?_.i c u: ... l ,.i..
linu six |>ruit:?auraua|i(i vuiuravmg ?hi; nuuiv aaiiK*

es of Physiology and Pathology allowed to lie con
coaled by the offal of the anatomical chain, or dimly
and lustrously peering from the rubbish of demol

stand proudly among the departments, and, in tbeii
beauty and brilliancy, shine by their own and nut
reflected light. Attempt to conceal them, and the]
but display the raeagreneas of every barrier. The]
deserve by their own merits a distinct place; bu
if they possess not this claim, the profession stl
deem them entitled to individuality; and he wouU
be a reckless creature who would not heed thii
demand.
In the existing faculty, there nre men of tnlenti
and extensive views, and we would appeal to then
individually, whether they do not believe that rlieii
organization is incomplete without the chair of Phy
siology and Pathology! W e ask Dr Pattison, if with
the multiform duties ofhischair, embracing General
Special, and Surgical Anatomy, he. can present t
full and succinct description of all investigation!
which have resulted in the magnificent strruciure o
modern Physiology 1 We appeal to Professor Re
vere, to say whether the fundamental and essential
substratum of nil the theories of medicine,?the de
scription of individual diseases, their terminations,
Arc., are not de|<eiident upon a thorough acquaintance
with Physiology and Pathology 1 We solicit
Doctors Molt and Draper, to declare, whether the
organ:/, it ion of the present faculty is in accordance
with the present demands of the profession 1 Wi,e.
ther it would be tolerated in any part of Europe ; ir
England or on the continent 1 It would not; and the
history of Medical Education in this country, tilde
pendent of Europe, otrers a sufficient reply. If not
why announce to the profession a " National insti

Why compromit, in the eyes of the world, the ud

Are Uie resources of New-York again to be reptidt

sway, and declaring hersell i" Mistress V No: oui
resources are great and unrivalled ; for ourselves, wi
are willing that the existing faculty should " win ant

deaf ear and merely promise for the future, we wii
join the crusade against them, heart and hand, will
any opposition, to retain to New-York the proud ent
nence she now possesses Success has ahead)
crowned the efforts ol the Faculty, Hnd theyshoulc

they have a right to c hum at their hands, and the)
will receive lis firm and undivided support. Tt
meet these demands, they should forthwith an
nounce their determination (previous to any move
from another quarter) to enlarge their present ficiil
ty ; Ht leasi 10 embrace the two departments It
w Inch we have alluded. In doinjj so, they will t x
tend their influence at home, and inspire confidence

accomplished, and by lending your important influ

Failure?The way to do Bu?int?sDear
Bennett:?
Being a constant reader of your valuable and abl;
conducted paper, my mind is frequently (truck
with astonishment and surprise, to see the enoi
' mous and widely extended correspondence thu
. find* its way to public observation, through th
medium if the Herald, from Maine to Georgia, an
from the Atlantic to (ha Pacific. Kmbracing thi
- ri?t Republic, theru is nothing that transpires, o
. any importance or interest, to its thousand of rend
era, but what we find the Herald foremast in devo
' loping.
The Herald here, in our city, is emphatically th
i lp h Whenever news or information, upon th
important and most interesting topics of the day, ii
desired, it is not uufrequenily that youragents heri
fall fur short of the increased demand for your pa
per.
You must feel flittered at the favorsble eoniidu
i ration in which 1 have represented the character oi
1 your journal ; for 1 have thousands here to bcai
witness to the sober truths 1 have expressed ; at
the same time assuring you, that were my cbuncci
for fame and fortune ns bright, as I deem yours tc
be, 1 would not thank Unclu Sum to be my uncle.
Most of our flour dealers here have been thrown
upon their beam-ends, in eonsequence of a large
firm in Virginia, P. &. S , flour dealers, failing to
reimburse a number of houses here, in the flout
trade, for their r.ceeptancea, amounting, in the aggregate,
to some #80,000 The most that any one
firm accepted for was #3d,000? ranging downward
'o <$5000. which is the smallest liability of any
house. These acceptances were made in good laith
1 uoon promises, but no guarantee, that flour to the
? full amount of the respective acceptors, should be
> placed in band in tini? to meet the draft* ; but tailinn
t0 J" this, their acceptor* had either to advancethe
m mey or let the draft* be protested. The
result was the latter course. Consequently, *ome
1 (out of seven or eight who slopped) are amongst
the most prominent flour dealer* in < ur city ; but
> we hare many yet left that will stand the test ol
! tighter time* than we hare at present.
1 It is generally thought, howerer, that no loss will
! ensue in the end to the acceptor*. Thedraweri
being gentl men of high character and integrity,
have marl" a deed of trust, securing all houses thai
r are liable for their acceptances,their property beio;
large and very valuable ; so our friends in town,
' although legally bo?nd, f el secure that, in the end.
r they will alTcnmr it at the big end of the horn
' swearing by gar,. shall never be caught in sucl;
' a dilemma again ; I never will make another bar
' gain without holding in one hand an equivalent ti
1 what I pay with the other. This occurrence k;lh
' all future operations of this kind here for the nex
two years. It is too much like your stock-jobbing
1 men of Wall street, and ought to be discouuteiian
ced by every intelligent merchant.

t is very depressed here, and money very scarce,

The dancing assembly at the American, on Thurs* ,v.|
i day evening, was well attended?not large, but to- sh
lerably so?composed of the flite or "bloods" of "h
our village, as tbey are called here ; and was the jj"
most magnificent and brilliant affair of the kind we j ^
' have witnessed here in many a day. .
Among the ladiea present was Miss 5., of Genesee
street, certainly the fairest of the fnir, and a
1 most exquisite dancer too?one of the beat in the .
' room. airs. 8 . of North street, but recently wed- ,
(led, commanded a great deal ol attention, being an le
| elegant figure, and pos-csscd of an unusual share of
modesty and grace; she is also a splendid dancer. !'
Then thcrs were the Mints (J g, of Ow-aten
street, rather tall, but exceedingly fair The Miss- ca
e? S , of Grnverstreet, as usual, looking well,taste- J?
fully dressed, and also dancing well. I he Misses
IV s, Genesee street, splendidly adorned, danced
well, and looked better ; last, although not j"
least, Miss K,, from Syracuse, appeared in elegant !"
, dress, and certainly a lair specimen of what Syracusedoes
possess. Aside from these, were many V
more nho would i;racc any assembly room in town, !"
? village or city. 1
The gentlemen pr< sent looked unusually well.? ,n
There were Mr. I' s, elegantly attired, of pro- '!
' pnssesti-g appearance, and quite a favorite with ^
I the ladies, although not appearing very zealous, *
f generally, in their behalf ; >lr C., his cousin, ele- j
gantly dressed, of good tnnn ; dan sen well, and W(
3 looks well ; Mr B n, also appeared in fine *pi ()f
rits, as usual ; seemed perfectly at home and dsnf
red with ea?e, and withal is a great lady's insn ; and, .
finally, Mr. B., commonly called the "Counsellor,"
appeared delighted and seemed to enjoy the occa
^ sirn ; he i> a bachelor, and an able lawyer too?a
y great admirer of the fair sex, ar.d a good judge of
f beauty likewise. .,
All seemed to enjoy themselves. The ladies, in
1 p irtieitlar, appeared in splendid dresses, fitted out '
I in a taste and fashion well calculated to show off
J thrir charms to the best advantage.
. '{'he table *et upon the occasion, by Gen. Wood, J.
"mine host" of the American, was also a splendid
affair?actually loaded down with rich aad sub *
r> stantiul viands, m ally arranged aad superbly serred
up. In fine, every thing passed off with entire
' satisfaciion, harmony and good feeling. r<
The Donation Party, got uu for the benefit of Dr ,Vl
H Lat'arop, at his house, last Wednesday, passed off ni
? swimmingly well, with a crowded home and liberal
gifts But it would have been far better and
more agreeable had they been still more liberal,
even to profuaeness ; fur never were gifts better or
more properly bestowed He is the most able
divine we have among us ; besides being one of
the most popular.
The othei societies will be following suit soon "
no doubt The first Pre?b. terian Society ought to
' he up and doing in this matter, if they are not al'
ready rnak ing arrangements, and bestow thrir gifts ''
1 bountifully upon " Father Hopkins," their stated
preacher He certainly deserves a rich benificence
' from their hands. And the other societies in town lo
' should also act in this matter ; for such things not ^
1 only serve to encoursge ministers of the Gospel, ""

I have the pleasure of furnish ug you the follow5
account <>l Elder Knapp and one of his sermons,
lieh was politely furnished me by a young man
talent, ami who is the sou of an Orthodox clergyin

The Lord has been pouring out hia spigjt abuantly
in this city for some time past, and more eeciafy
during the past week, when we have been
rored with the ministrations of F.lder Knapp.?
lie preaching of this godly man has been attended
ith signal -uccrss ; liniversalists and Infidels are
tind upon the anxious heats, and thousands are inuring
the way to salvation. Perhaps a better idea
in be formed of this divine, by a short sketch of
le of his discourses, which we were graciously
luchsafed with an opportunity of listening to. On
reduetday evening lust, (29th nit.) he preached at
e church in ]?!>ldwin Place, from these words?
>hn 111,7. " Marvel sot that 1 aaid unto thee, ye
list be horn again." He commenced with an aciunt
of the circumstances connected with which
e words ol the text arc spoken?then proceeded
explain tke nature of ihe new birth, and the inirnccs
necessary to produce it. He said that God
eated the world by physical force, but the regeirat
ion of the s'nner was to ba effected by mental
rce S.,id he, " suppose a p'anet should stop ia
i orb, and refuse to roll round, think you that Ged
nuld read the ten commandments to it 1 ho yort

Heated, perhaps there is'ntany tire, or it may I e

till the brick* get hot in the house where you

d humility, the reverend gentleman remarked
Suppose a mob should collect in this city, and go

ockingdowu and dragging out, plundering from

divine of this city,and others, we believe, have
own their wisdom hy taking no part,and claiming
- fellowship with Rider Knopp; and he alluded to
em in this manner, " Let Paul come down from
c bliss and gloiy o: heaven, where he would look
er the battlements, and see the myriads who
sell iu the pit of despair, and hear their wails

that his proceedings appeared foolish I" the
'regenerate, und < xrmed it on this ground?"Region

HUhly Important from the Mormon Country
on the Mississippi ?1'iogrrnrt of the
Latter Day galnts?The New Jttevelatloii
Z?lng ahead,
Yesterday we received highly important dispatches
trom our correspondent, who resides in Nauvoo, the
chief eity of the Mormons on the Mississippi?
called by the Latter Day Saints the beautiful city of
Ciod.
This intelligence is of the most interesting and curions
character.
The Mormons, under the guidance of their great
ptophet and seer, the famous .loe Smith, are organizing
a rehgiousempire in the far west mat wili astonish
the world in these latter days Civil, religious, military,
judicial, social, moral, advertising, commercial
organization, are all embraced within the comprehensiveness
of tlieirnew system?or their new revelation
fresh from God himself, in theii own enthusiastic
language. The astonishing mixture of worldly
prudence and religious enthusiasm?of perfect
system and wild imagination?of civilized reason
with ancient ideas?of religious observance and military
organ1* itinn, is without a parallel in the history
of natians since the time of Mahomet. The
model of Joe Smith, the Mormon Prophet seems to
b- the great Jewish legislator, Moses, Both coin
bined religious, political, moral, and social institutions
in one muss of legislation and empire The
Saviour of the world and his disciples separated
th *se awful elements of despotism, and gave to religion,
a separate, distinct, intellectual, etherial moral
impulse of its own, fit to promote happiness here
and beattitude hereafter. The corruptions of the
church, in the lime of Coastantine the Great, united
nil these, under the general name of Councils.
This banpful combination produced the awful und
despotic Roman Hierarchy, till the majestic genius
of Luther, like another apostle Paul, rose up and separated
the elements again and re-established the
principles of Jesus of Nazareth.
The numerous sects?the contrariety of opinions?
the corruption of the times, have increased to such a
degree, that every now and theu the master-spirits
in religion are rising np every where, and attempting
to unite the same elements that the Roman Emperor
did?and to frame an empire that can be controlled
by religious opinions aluiie. Such is the
policy of the Right Reverend Bishop Hughes of this
city?and such is the direction which his holiness,
Jom ph Smith, President of the Church o| Ratter l>*y
Saints, gives, on their beautiful banks of the Mississippi.
This country?this singularly constituted re- '
public is the field for these isolated and wonderful
efforts of religious genius and religious ambition.
The revelation, or the developement, or the system
of the Mormons, is the most original of
the present age. It is far more adapted to the
prei-ent century?and to modern civilization, than
the Romish system. It combines simplicity?good J
sense?belief in any quantity?love?morals?energy?industry?liberty
of the press?moderation ?
singleness of purpose?enthusiasm?de votion?tern
prance?imagination?in 'in* vast and massive system
?f civilization Their piogresscorresponds with
their principles. In two years, the Holy City of God,
Nnuvoo, has risen from a few houses, to possess
10,0.10 souls, besides much cattle, all animated by
the same spirit?believing the same faith?obeying
ike same moral rules?and combined in the same
great purpose of regenerating the race of man on
earth. They believe that they po.-aessa direct revelatten
from heaveu?and who can gainsay the in ?
Who can say that thou licet T Has not Joe Snuth
as g? oj a right to be considered the vicegerent of
(too, as the i'ope ot Home ?
Wi h 'h'-?e remark^, rend the following very curic-u
intelligence, shewing the progress of this nsw
religious, moral, and social empire, that must one
day, eontroul the whole valley of the Mississippi,
from the peaks of the Alloghanies to the pinnacles
of the Rocky Mountains:?

AN EPISTLE
Of the Twelve to the Saints of the Last Days*
The building of the Temple of the Lord, in the city of
Nauvoo, is occup) ing the tii st place in the exertion* uml
prayers of many of the saints at the present time, kno vr*
ing as they do, that, if this building is not completed,
speedily, " wr shall bt rrjieltd at a church with our drad,"
for the Lord our God hath ipokeu it ; but while many
are thus engaged in laboring, and w atching and praying
for this all important object, there are many, very
many more, who do not thus coine up to their privih ge
and their duty in this thing, and in mauy instances we
are confident that their n. gh-ct arises from a want of
propm understanding of the principles upon which this
jiiibling is founded, and by which it must be completed.
The children of Israel were commanded to build a
house in the laud of promise; and to are the auiuts ul the
last Hays, as yon will see in thu Revelation given to
JOSEPH [SMITH] the SEER, Jan.JHtMMl, wherein
for ages, even their anointing*, and washing* nud haphemtfar
the (teaJ; wherein they may meet in tolemu ua
lem blies for their memorials, sacrifices, uud oracle* in
their most holy place* ; and wherein tliey may receive
couveraatious and statutes, and judgment* for the beginning
of the revelation* and foundation* of Zion.and the
glory and honor and adornment of all her municij las,
through the medium which (iod hath nrdainnd.
In the lame revelation the command iato " all thrsaintn
from ajar,'' a* well a* those already gathered to this
place, (o arise with one consent and build the T? mple ;
to prepare a place where the Moat High may manifest
himself to hi* people. No one j* excepted who hath
aught in hi* iioseeKtion, for what have ye that ye have
not received? and I will require mine own with usury
saith the Lord; so that those who live thousands of miles
from this place, come under the same law', and are entitled
to the same blessings and privileges as those who
hare already gathered But sotnn may say how can this
he, I am not there, therelore 1 cannot meet in the Tern
pit; cannot be baptized in the Font? The command of
heaven is to you,to all, gather: and win n y ou arrive here,
if it is found'that you have pieviously tent tip of your
gold or your silver, or your-ubstunce, the tj things und
consecrations which are ri quired of you for this huildiug,
you will find your names, tithinga, und conseci utions
w ritten in the Book of the Law oft he Lord, to be kept in
the Temple,as a witnessin your favor showing that you
are a proprietor in that building, and are entitled to your
share of the privileges thereunto belonging.
One of those privileges which is particularly attracting
the notice of the saints at the present moment, is baptism
lor the dead, Use. in the font, which is so far completed
as to b<- dedicated, and several have ulteady attended
to this ordinance, by w hich the sick hove been
made whole, and the prisoner set free ; but while we have
been called to administer this ordinance, we have been
led to inquire into tho propriety ol baptising those who
have not been obedient, and assisted to build the place
for baptism, and it seems to ua unreasonable to expect
that the Great Jebcvah will upprobate such an administration
; for if the church must be biought under condemnation
and rejected w ith her dead it she fail to build the
house, and its sppur tcnances, why should not indiriduals
| of tli e church who thus neglect, come under the same condemnation
Ami if they are to be rpjected they may as
well be rejected without baptism os with, for their baptism
cau be of no avail before God, and the lime to baptise
them may be' appropriated to b Hiding the walls of
the house, and this is uccoiding to the understanding
which we have received from him who is our spokesman.
Let it not be supposed that the sick and tho destitute
are to be denied tho blessings of the Lord's House ; God
forbid ; his e) e is ev er upon them for good. He that hath
not, uud cannot obtain, but sank in his heart if I had, I
would give freely, is accepted aslreely as he that gives
of his abundance." The Temple is to be built by ty thing
and consecration, and every one is at liberty to consecrate
all they find in tin ir hearts so to do ; but the ty thin?,
i-i.miir. .4 in oiu- tenth of nil an v one nossessed at th
commencement of the building. and one tenth part ol all
hi* ill ere US from that time till the completion of the
B*me. whether it be money or whatever he may he bleifid
with Many, in this place, am laboring every tenth
day for the house, and ttili m the ty thing of their income,
lui thiy have nothing die ; others would labor the iamu
but they urusick, tkereloit-, excusable, when they get
well Ut tin m begin: w bile there are others who appear
to think their own busini ss of more importance than the
Lords, to such we w ould ask, who gave you your time,
health, strength, and put you into business 7 and will
you not In gin quickly to return w ith usury that which
you have received? Our God will not wait always.
We would remind some two or three hundnd Klders,
u ho offere I to go out on missions, some six months, others
one year, and some two years, and had their millions as
lignt d them at the general conference to labor on the
Tt tnple, that most of their names are still with us, and we
wish them to tall and take their names away, and give
them up to the tuilding committee Brethren you have as
great an interest at stake m this thing as we have, but as
our Master, even the Master builder of the T. mplu, whose
tinono is on high, has se< n lit to constitute us stewards
in some parts ol his household, we feci it important for
us to see to it that our Master is not defrauded, and especially
by those who have pl> dge.i their w old, their tmc,
their tali tits, to his services; and we hone this gentle
hint will su Mice, that w e may not be compelled to publish
the names of those referied to.
Probably some may think they could have gone on u
mission but cannot labor n? they h ivc no menus of boardingtni
involves, but let such rememberthat several score
oi I rethien and sistets in this city etf> red to the general
conf rence, to board one or mote laborers on the Temple
till the same should be completed, and but ft w ol
those, as y i t,hav< had the opportunity ol boarding. Tu
all such we would say you aiP not lnrgottun, we have
your names, al?o, anil we expect soon to send some one
to your table, therefore put your houses in order and
never be ready to reluxe the hrst offer of a guest.

The Lkgisi-vture ?The Legislature at Albany,
seem to be trying to imitate their illustrious predecessors
at Washington. And yet there has never
been a section of the Legislature when there has ,ri
b en such important bu-iness to transact. A crisis t0
has come in the legislative action of all the States, ni
and their movetnt nta this winter will form an epoch P'
in the history ol these republics. The payment of P!
a just and honorable debt, has, miral>Ue dirlu, be- ai
come a question, and this question is now presented Ul
to the respective Legislatures of most of the States
lor their decision. To pay, or not to pay, that is the
question. And we call upon the Legislature of '*
our own yet honorable State to come out bold- P1
ly and fearlessly and put her veto, and her wi- 'J
thcring denunciation, upon this foul doctrine of
repudiation, which, like a pestilential miasma, ''
I is now tainting the air of some of the States. P'
If the revenue of the State be not adequate to the 8,1
prompt discharge of any debt, or the interest upon any I"
debt as soon asit falls due,then we call upon the lecis- 111
lature.like a skilful and faithful physician,to prescribe
a dc se of taxation Depend upon it, the disease B
will make such ravages in the constitution of the 31
State as will be infinitely worse than the remedy P'

Such is the annunciation of the course winch
the Captain of the deck." and the Faculty
tend to pursue. But will such a course be
lerated 1 Is it to be supposed, for one moent,
that any man, or body ol men, shall he
rmitted to institute a censorship of the public
ess 1 The same game has been played in Loudon
id Dublin, and the pre?s has most signally trinphed.
Mr. Abernethy, the eminent English but on,
instituted legal proceedings against the Lenin
I.cincet, in order to prevent it publication of verUim
reports of his lector- s, but it was decided that
nblic leetures, when delivered, became the prop?r
cf lb ?- who purchased, or obtained a right to
Ear them, and that persons w ho thus attended on
tern, could si ll, print, publish, or in any way disose
of their notes of such lectures. In Dublin the
ime question was tr.od, in aoa-e in which the prorietorsof
the " Ah-.Iical Pnat" were defendants,
id the result was a similar verdict, in tbeir
vor. "The Captain of the deck," in hs
ill which he has filed in the Court of Chancery,
ssumes the ground that he can prevent the
liberation of his lectures because they are his
ncluaive property. They are no such thing,
le ells th-in to Uis students at twenty dollars a head,
lis students can take verbatim notes of them, and

The Senate was not in session on Saturday, ai d ^ |
'he House was mainly occupied with a preliminary ^ (j
movement, which threatens the repeal of the Bankrupt
Law. Petitions were referred to the Commit- ^
tee on the Judiciary, with instructions to reports .,
bill on Tuesday next, for the repeal of the Bankrupt 6,1 e
Law, by a majority of some twentv-four votes, which ceP'
will be swelled to upwards of thirty on the return of '"!P
certain gentlemen who are now absent. The erasure *f
of the Bankrupt Law from the Statute Book, appears
to be determined upan, and not the least 80U.'
singular part of the proceeding, is the summary man- """
ner in which the work is commenced, no debate
being either permitted or desired by the friends or B,on
foes of the measure. This movement will cause C|Ue
much consternation through the land, but notwithstaading
the threatening aspect of affairs, there is .
room for hope that the contemplated repeal may be . .
frustrated. S'VI

Tne Verdict against Mr. Van Zandt.?This hie'
verdict of $3,000, brought in by the jury against this grat
! Reverend seducer, was published yesterday in the reil
Herald exclusively?not another city paper contained 'net
it. The public will soon be convinced whom they ^un
must look upon on Sundays for news. This verdict ltev
against Mr. Van Zandt has taken every one here by invt
purprise, especially those who know his brethren hav
and relatives in this city. But it seems he is better hesi
known in Rochester; and we are not at liberty to T
suppose that a Rochester jury have done him any P?si
injustice. On the whole, this is a very curious af- in e
fair?a very singular departure of a clergyman from whi
the line of his duty. We hope his brethren will not

The Memorial of the undersigned respectfully tl0K
aheweth?That vour memorialists are informed and Sta
believe that the Charter of The North River Bane, ty.t
of the City of New York, will expire by its own limitation
on or nbout the first day of July next; ever eno
since its incorporation, the said institution has been a ki
located ?n the west side of said City, and near the any
North or Hudson River: that the affairs of the same c
are well conducted ; and that said Bank is absolutely
necessary for the convenience and reasonable demands
of the people in its neighborhood: and that 1
the uHthdrawal of the capital thereof at the present gen
time would produce difficulties and derangements in aQC|
the business and reasonable expectations of its dealera
and others. _ _ "ca
Yout memorialists venture the opinion that the time ing
is near when more instead of less Rank capital will be ma,
requisite and proper on the west side of the city of .
New York. When, in the year 1821, this Bank was ; .
incorporated, no Canal had been completed within i' 18
this Stale: no Railroad had even been projected ges
within it; the power of steam was but partially ap p|e?
predated: internal improvements ?f value had *
scarcely been seriously commenced in any of our re8c
sister States ; and the population and commerce of bou
the City of New York, and most especially in the j3w
western part of it, would scarcely deserve to be compared
with their present prosperous condition.
But at this time how different the situation and wn?
prospects of our country ! That noble monument of bles
the wisdom of our State, the Great Erie Canu", and me,
its many tributaries, have been constructed and put ,
into the most successful operation ; these naturally 018
terminate onthe North River, along the westerly set i
side of the City of New York. Various and exten- witl
stve railroads have been completed in our own state a
and internal improvements in other states have been
undertaken and pressed on to an almost iucredtble
extent ; and the New York and Erie Railroad, the Bri{
greatest work of modern times, has been so fur cur- e(an
ried forward by private enterprise, aided by this .
state, that it will ere long pour into the City of New 8U|U
York a mighty ma* of products, wealth ar.d com pab
merce ; exchanging the surplus of the rich regions p|ei
of the west for others of our own and foreign nations t,._

Bank is known and acknowledged, Believing its S*'11

e Bankrupt Kill?Will It be Repealed?
Temperance?Mr. Marshall.
vote was taken in the House to-day which indis
a determination to repeal the Bankrupt law, so
as the action of that body ia concerned. Its fate
le Senate is doubtful,though the better opinion is,
: a repeal bill cannot be carried. If the Senate
II retrace itaatepe, and undo what was achieved
he extra session, after great labor and manageit,
under the preaeing demands of the people,
honest unfortunate debtor must look to the PrenU>.
,aiii?r iTnH>>r ordinary circutnstan*
it would be hardly proper for the Executive to
rpose and arrest the passage of a repeal bill; bat
is an extraordinary case, and a veto would seom
e dictated alike by humanity, by wisdem, and
id judgment. The subject was brought to the
ce of Congress by a special message from tha
cutive. The law was passed and after fnll discuri,
and a thorough examination into all the causesees,
immediate and remote Nothing has sinee
spired to change the aspect of the question, or
>w any new light upon it. The law has not gone
operation, and it is proposed to repeal it without
ng an opportunity to ascertain its effect. Is such
ricious legislation?such child's play?compatiwith
the dignity of Congress*?is it worthy a
tc, deliberative body T We know not what
>onse the members themselves may maks to
se interrogatories, but it is certain that the five
dred thousand bankrupts who hoped to be re
ed by the beneficent operations of this law?will
ike the vengeance of the people upon those who,
ing held the cup to their lips, now seek, without
itation or compunction, to dash it from them,
'he movement of the tariff men towards ihe imitionof
high protective duties is most injudicious
very point of view. It comes from the northern
gs, and cannot fail to have a disastrous effect,
1 on the party and the in:erests of their constitui.
No wise tariff man will open his mouth about
tective or discriminating duties. A tariff for reue,
which shall raise money sufficient for the
-? ? tKo ernimrnm^nf will cfivi* nmrilp nrnfpc
i to every manufacturing interest in the United'
tea. We require an average duty of at least thirhree
per cent on our imports to raise mney
ugh to meet the demand on the treasury. With
nowledge of this fact, it is not surprising that
man should raise the que stion of protection in
igrese 1

'he cause of temperance is exciting a deep and
eral interest in this city. To the philanthropist
the patriot its progress is a source of high gratition*
The vice to which it is opposed is the crysin
and desolating scourge of our land. How
ty noble victims has it prostrated ; what countruins
strew the path of this fell destroyer. Bat
among the poor and the ignorant that its ravaare

Lethean draught and Circi&n clip. Those, then,
j occupy the superior stations of life, and are
red with the advantages of education and refineit,
have less excuse to justify, or rather palliate,
fatal indulgence. It is, moreover, their duty to
a public example to such as look up to them
a respect and confidence.
everal members of our national legislature have
this solemn obligation, among whom Mr
jgaolVMaatachusetts is conspicuous. He is ia
it in season and out of season, in advancing that, I
tary reformation to which he has dedicated his I
lie example and preeepts. W? feel a peculiar I
tsure in adding another name to this meritorious
d. It is that of the Hon. Mr. Marshall of Ken- I

rd. Though ardent in temperament and of strong
julees, the heat of debate never provokes him inwanton
offence. He is bleat with that enviable
ulty in a public man?
" That sense, the bland philosophy or life,
" yhich check* discutsiun ere it wa:m? to
duch injustice has ben done ts this gentleman,
ough malevolence or ignorance. Of a free and
hiding character, he has not always set that
ict guard upon himself which a more cauus
and selfish nature places, often as a co
for defects. Of a social und convivial die"
ntion, he opens himself as frankly and unsusciingly
as though he were always surrounded by
,'uds, unxioi.'S to make every generous allowance
those failings which are connected with, if they
: not the offspring of our best feelings. IJnt it ia
safe to trust the strongest mind or the most robust
institution too far. In ths prime and strength of
inhood, with health unimpaired and intellect unnrned,
he accordingly resolved to anticipate,rathef
in wait, for those painful lessons which the votas
of convivial pleasure receive, alas! olten too
e. With Mr. Marshall, to resolve is to do, and
th a manly front. Ha at once stepped fonvan^ ,
d publicly enrolled his nam* with those who have
emilly pledged themselves, to resist by dHe<-.un;en- ^
ce the charms of the syren. At a meeting held
it night, at the Medical College, Mr. Marshall not
ly inscribed his name to the pit dge, but,when turntly
called upon, made a few rema*k?, with his
aracteristic eloquence, and distinguished by equal
ode-ty and feeling. They were listened to with
nost affec tionate interest by a numerous audiepce,
mid and grauful to set to noble a spirit come up
the rescue.
We are persuaded there is not a man, of ai.y ^oct
party, who will not hail this annunciation with
culiur satisfaction, for the admiration which geus
inspires is confined to neither. Wo are made
reverence any thing which adorns or elevates our 7

Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to rej^rt

The question coming up to lay the petition on the

The roll vai again railed through, when 10-i member!
answered to their names. Further proceedings under
'the rail were then dispensed with, and the doors were
pened.
Mr. Fillmork hoppt that hi* colleague. (Mr. Chitten
den.) would withdraw hi* motion to lay the petition on
the table, so that the House might come to u direct
vote on the ins1 ructions themselves. Here were many
members who would vote against laying a petition ou
the table, who were opposed to a repeal of the bankrupt
law He thought the preferable mode would he to take
the note on the instructions so as to make it a test quela
tion (Cries of Agreed, Agreed.)
Mr Chittssdi* agreed to this suggestion, and withdrew
his motion to lay the petition ou the table.
Mr. Warren then moved to lay the instruction* on the
table.
Upon this question the ayes and noes were demanded,
and were?uvea 90, noes 114.
Mr! Lake then begged his colleague to withdraw the
previous question, to enable him to make a statement.
The Sfkakfr informed the gentleman from Indiana
that if any debate arose, the sut ject would have to lie
Tar.
Mr. Lark said be wished merely to make a statement,
"but dies of'* dont withdraw the previous question," being
beard from various quarters, the previous question
was not withdrawn The previous question was then
seconded. and on the question." shall the main question
be now putt"
Mr. Barnard demanded the Ayes and Noes, which
Were ordered, and were, Ayt i IN, Noes 97.
The question then coming upon referring the petition
to the Committee on the Judiciary with iustructions to
bring in a bill to repeal tue Bankrupt Law,
a Mr. Paoi-rir inquired if it would be in order to mere an
amendment, by a iding the word " forthwith."
The Sflirfr said it was not in order, tha previous
question having been moved.
The Stkarkr then aunounced tho first questiantobe
I on the instruction.
, Mr. Howard, (at twenty minutes past one o'clock,)
moved that the House adjourn.
The Ayes and Noes en this motion were ordered, when
K was withdrawn by the mover.
Mr. Barnard renewed the motion to adjourn, qpon
which the Ayes and Noes were ordered, and were, Ayea
ta, Noea 147.
The question was then taken on the adoption of the
instruction*, but before the result was announced,
_ Mr Hunt, who had come into the Hall alter his name
was colled, desired to bo p*> mitted to make a brief statement.
He said that he had been absent from his seat
since Monday last, from severe indisposition, and he had
come to the House this morning under the protection of
a friend, and against the advice of his physician. But
be had a number of petitions and memorials, praying
that no steps may ke taken to repeal the Bankrupt Law,
which he had been unable to present earlier, and under
thes, circumstances, he asked the privilege of recording
bis vote in the negative.
Mr. nOPRIPS OUJOCIOU, una u ic4>uiiug uuiuiuiuui
OOSeut, the permission wti not granted.
The Tote was then announeed?ayes 116, noei 94
So the petition was referred with instruction* to the
ommittee on the Judiciary, to report a bill for the reMai
of the Bankrupt Law.
Mr. Cave Johniop moved a reconsideration of the vote^
and demanded the previous question, which was ordered.
This motion was made to prevent a reconsideration
bein^ moved hereafter, that motion being in order but
one on any question.
Mr. Beopsop moved thatthe House adjourn.
Mr. Clifford asked for the eyes and noes,which were
ordered, and the motion to edjeurn was withdrawn.
The question was then taken on reoonsidering the
Tote, and decided in the negative.
Mr. Marshall presented a memorial of citizens ol
Louisville, praying a repeal of the hankrupt law; and n
Memorial of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of
Louisville, for the same object; which he moved might
bo referred to the committee en the judiciary, withinItrurtion*
to report forthwith a bill repealing the hank.
rnptlaw,and on that he demanded the previous question
[Cries of " Agreed?that's right."
Mr. Staple objected to the word " forthwith." This
Mramary made of proceeding savored more of locofocoi*m
than of whiggery.
Mr. Hofkips suggested to his friend from Kentucky
t*r. M arshalljlto insert "Monday next"instead of "forth.
With" [Cries of Agreed agreed ]
Mr. Marshall said as the word u forthwith" was ohjectrd
to, though it was strictly classical, he would substitute
for it " Monday next."
Mr. Arpold rose to a point of order. The House had
-a xlrt .il> referred a petition with a similar object, and he
submitted that the present motion was out of order.
The Spkakkr said there was a similarity between
them, but there was sufficient difference to make the pre
out motion in order.
Mr. AapoLO then inquired whether it was in order tc
Instinct a committee to bring in ? hill on a specific day
The Spkakkr said there was no particular rule for it
but it was undoubtedly within the power of the Housi
to give such instructions.
Mr. Arpold asked if the Speaker had any recollectior
of svtch a courso Laving been heretofore adopted.
Tho Sfkarkr decided the motion to be in order.
The previous question was then seconded, and th<
question being on ordering the main question to be put.

The Sfkarkr decided the uietion to he out of order, ai
the r revious question had been seconded.
Mr. Irwip then moved thut the House adjourn.
M r. Clifford called for the ayes and noes, whicl

Mr Hirparu rose to a point of order, and inquire!
under what rule the presentation of petitions iwas ii

petitions.
The Spearfp. sai l that the House had yenterdav sns

Th question wax then taken on the a.ljournraent, and
it was decided in the nrgaliv'. ? ayes 38, noes 158.

Philadelphia, Jan. 9,1S42.
But little has transpired since I wrote you yesterday,
of a news character. I hu?e ascertained
that the defalcation in the Contributionship Association,
mentioned yesterday, has been greatly exaggerated
by rumor, and in stating the amount,
thousands substituted for hundreds. The default
will probably not exceed fifteen or sixteen hundred
dollars, which is fully covered by security.
We shall have'quite a procession and parade here
en Tuesday morning, by those interested in the
opening of the Philadelphia, Reading and Potts
ville Railroad. A large number of the Tottsvil
lians will be brought down with a loaded train of
care on Monday evening, who, on the following
morning, will form in procession, march through
some of our streets, and then return with an acocs
sion from this city, to Pottuville, where in the
evening is to come off a grand ball. The stock of
this company yesterday fell $1 ou a share; 1 hope
not, however, in consequence of this high frolic.
At the Chcsnut and National theatres last night,
there were fire company benefits, and, of course,
good houses. At the Walnut and Arch,only so so;
but at the circus there was'atmther overflowing assemblage.
To-morrow night, ftiehings takes a
benefit in a new piece written for him by the editor
of the Dramatic Mirror?said to be pretty good.
Much apprehension is entertained here by the
holders of State stocks, lest the next arrival should
deluge our maiket with stocks sent over in cousequence
of the alarm created iu England by the news
of the repudiation movements in Mississippi
That news, it is feared, will create an alarm that
will aot be confined to that State alone. This ap
prehension is probably sue of the strongest reasons
for the decline of the s'.oek of our State, when it is
so positively promised that the February interest
will be paid.
We have to-day the most delightful weather that
I ever saw in this mrridian, for January. It is as
warm and as calm as June, and at the calling and

Sunday, Jan. 9?0 P. N.
The liabilities of the United States Bank have been
the subject of a good deal of speculation. They have
been made the iustrument of speculation, not only on
the part of those that owed the bank, but on the part of
thoso who wished to purchase it* asset*. Some months
since, a few capitalists in Boston sent to Philadelphia to
make a purchase from the United States Bank of a large
amount of Philadelphia and Reading Railroad stock.
The purchase was completed at SO, payable in the note*
of the bank, six months credit, and the stock was
re-sold ia Boston at 26, for cash. The result of this
transaction will be, that a large amount of the notes
will be required. These notes have recently been selling
at 45 discount, and efforts have been made to depress
them, preparatory to closing the operation. The
amount now out must be vary small, as large sums have
been absorbed by payments into the bank.
Similar operations are going on in New Orleans.
When the United States Bauk purchased the Merchants'
Bank at New Orleans, she owned 2300 shares of the
Canal Bankof Orleans. On this she borrowed $30 per
share of the Canal Bank, to make up the purchase money
of the Merchants' Bank, and recently, when the Merchants'
Bauk was sold for $376,000, this same stock
was received back at the same rate, making $123,000;
$100,000 was borrowed from the Exchange Bank, and
$100 000 from the City Bank; the balauco, $230,000, was
paid in bills drawn on Louisville and Cincinnati. These
bills are now becoming due, and there is no means
of meeting them. They feel conliJeut, however, in
getting them renewed. The President of the Merchants'
Bank, with the view to control the election
which took place last month in the Canal Bunk, sent last
summer to this city, and purchased near 1000 shares of
the Canal Bank stock. These were paid by bills drawn
on his own agent, in this city, at 90, 100, and 120
days. The aoewptor bought the stock, transmitted
it to New Oileans, when it was immediately pledged to
the bank, the operator thus having the use of the money
four months before his bills lell due, besides controlling
tae election. The Canal Dunk it no w understood to be
borrowing money on its own stock, at the rate of lorty
cents,having previously loaned lilty upon it.
At Boston, yusterday, $11)09 State Fives, payable in
1847, with coupous, were sold at 92.
The rate of money injWall street, continues high. The
Banks show no disposition to increase their loaus. On
the contrary but a very small proportion of the offerings
are done. This is a matter of the highest necessity to
them while the government financial policy is an open
question. The bauks have, '.moreover been severely admnuished
during the past fall, that they cannot be too
cautious in giving encouragement to the import of goods
from abroad, more particularly when the appearance of
the foreign markets, renders the amount to be realised
from our produce very uucertain. The great staple,
cotton,is yet falling, aud up to the latest dates there
was no prospect of a revivad in demand. On the proceeds
of that crop the banks at this point, depend in a
great measure lor the means of meeting the demand for
bills or specie to remit abroad. A fall of one cent per lb.
makes a difference of $1j,000,000, in the amount to be
drawn against, and at this crisis, when it is impossible
to obtain such an amount of credit abroad, such a deficiency
would be fatal. To avoid the risk, cuitailnunt
to restrict imports is the only resource, more especially
while there is a proposition of increasing the currency
of the couatry by $16,000,000 of government paper. The
currency is now full, notwithstanding the low state to
which it is reduced. The following is a table of the circulation

The circulation of the free banks given for 12441, is an
estimate. The aggregate shows a reduction of 40 per cent
in the gross circulation, which reduction has taken place
in the last half of the year,an I wasrendcted necessary
by the increase manifest atjthe close of last year. Tha(
expansion in the first quarter of the cotton year, stimu
lated imports to greater extent than should have been the
case, taking into view the risks of the cotton market ?
The results were a fall in cotton, with heavy reclamations
on this side, a deficiency in the supply of bills, a
spocit drain and forced curtailment in the issu-s in the
last quarter of the cotton year,involving the failure el
tweuty weak banks, was the consequence.
Notwithstanding this violent action of two rival currencies,
that of the free banks, ami the chartered hanks
of the State of N-'W York, the business of New York
and New F.ngl.uid, has greatly increased, becausfi the
value of the currency has bean uniform, being cl ways
equivalent to specie , and those banks that have not been
able to maintain that value have been closed up. In
Massachusetts it will ho seen the amount of paper currency
has been slightly increased, while the trade ol
Boston has reached an amount never before known, as
seen in the following table af the imports and exports of
Boston.

Those figures will show that the aggregate h: sine-s
of New Yoik and New England has inert a*?-d twenty
per cent during the pas', ye.tr, while the currency of tin;
former has laigely derreast.I, and that of the latter remained
stationary. The conclusion to he derive I Ir. m
these facts is,that w ith short ere liti and a currency 10
which the most perfect confidence is reposed, a much
smaller amount of circulating me Hum is requisite In the
transaction of a given quantity of business, than with >
fluctuating inflated currency. The reason is ebvi it.
When the curr. ncy is constantly varying,prices flucttia'e
rapidly? dealers become timid, and make their pur
chsses rautioueiy. The currency, therefore, meres
sluggishly. On the other hand, when the volume of the
medium is low, prices are steady, and coafi lence being
jxrfset in the result of operation*, the movement of the
cum ncy is mpH. Merchandise changes hand* with
gre a facility, and th. . ,1' ct upon prices is the ramo.hiit
much more h< aithy than under aw in ritsr. .1 paper cuirency.
On this principle, there is no doubt hut tl.a
$5 (ton ore) on a perfect sp-ri. hi,is, ivill actually p. 1. >rm
as much business as w ould >14 000 000 of a fluctuating

cpHE PRIVATE TREAT18E.-TI.ii i< a little volume on
A certain diieaeei in which the beet and moat convenient
mean* of cure are elated in the plainest possible manner. Il
also shows the reason why these maladies so frequently continue
on from month to month,iincured. and terminate at le: gti
in other and permanent eomplaiu*s. Indeed, no oue can rear
this little book without seeing at uuee thnr true and ri al ns
lure, and aiso the risk and danger of trusting litem to ignorant
and boastiug people.
With a view, however, to obtain a rational degree of conb
dence in what he has advanced on the cure of those diseases, the
author thinks it proper here to give a ai-nole statement of the
means and opportunities he htmsall has had of forming just aud
clear opinions on this subject. He therefore begs to state, that
beside* his rank as graduate of Edinburgh, ai d member of the
London College. Ac. he has been walchiig these diseases, bolh
in Hospital and city practio lor more than thirty years, au<
has published two editions of a work expressly on them. Also
that ha has letters of commendation from the most rmiuein
physicians in Europe to the mos' eminent in America, as ?rr
Astley Cooper to Dr. Mott of New York and Dr. Physiek.ef
Philadelphia, and others, and which may be *?rn by any one
Aud Iurther. that he has the privilege of vel'emng lo almost
every phi siciau of eminence in Ibis city. These are circum
stances winch afford the highest satislaetion to every one, especially
to those who are anxious to obtain the best advice-.?
The price of the book is $t.

ON THE CURE OF STKIGTUKE-lt is most unfortu
rate in this complaint that many persouv have a stricture
who are not in the least aware of :t. The common notion
is. that so Inugasthe urine pasws in a tolerable stream, theie
cauoot be a stricture. But this is f r fmiutrn* Astrictinv
may. and often does exist for innuths. ai.d cirn rears, without
proJscuig any s>nkniE change tn this respect when a stricture
arrives at thalde-gree of narrowness a* sensibly to impei t
tlie oriae.it IS a serious m ilady indeed. The object of those
remarks however, i* to prevent this state, and to attack it at a
tune when rt is easily and perfectly removed. But there ate
other eircumstaiices besides its effect u;?in the urine by whicl
a stricture may be known, or. al least, strongly suspected, an,
though these are numerous, there arc.l wo which are very com
mon aud very easily judged of, aud these shall be uieutinued
here.
The first nftheee circumstances relates to time. It is well
huown that stnetures arise from long continued snd badlj

rough))' relied on. Itiueed the author never saw a ease o| atric

not, more or less. complain or his lose of mental energy?* ha'
he was not go capable of bustum* as formerly. The rrastu c 1
this, however, la clearly shown in Ins "Private Trealine," a
little volume noticed iu another column of this paper, and to
winch the reader is referred, md only f r knowledge of tins

I)K. RALPH further begg to add that he i ay l?e r< Bruited
personally a* lus residence, No dd Gte? nwich street, at any
hour ; and shyMd any he in doubt as totkf evist'-nce of th.a
disease, especially afler perusing his little volume, he will,
without expense or the least pain, explain and *-su**ehim whether
he have or not. Let it only he remembered that, if he really
lias a stricture, not ail the medicine in the world, alone,
will ever cure it. di*??-?
